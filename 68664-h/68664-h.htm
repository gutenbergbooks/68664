  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This work is one of the consequences of a conversation
years ago with Dr. C. F. Taylor, of Philadelphia, editor and
publisher of <cite>The Medical World</cite> and of Equity Series. The
doctor said that Equity Series should have a book on the
railroad question. The writer replied that there was room
for a book dealing with the political, industrial, and social
effects of different systems of railway ownership and control.
A plan was adopted for a book, to be called “The
Railways, the Trusts, and the People,” which is now on
the press of Equity Series. For the preparation of this
work the writer travelled through nine countries of Europe
and over three-fourths of the United States, studying railways,
meeting railroad presidents and managers, ministers
of railways, members of railway commissions, governors,
senators, and leading men of every class, in the effort to
get a thorough understanding of the railway situation. He
also made an extensive study of the railroad literature of
leading countries, and examined thoroughly the reports
and decisions of commissions and courts in railroad cases
in the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>As these studies progressed, the writer became more and
more convinced that the heart of the railroad problem lies
in the question of impartial treatment of shippers. The
chief complaint against our railroads is not that the rates
as a whole are unreasonable, but that favoritism is shown
for large shippers or special interests having control of
railways or a special pull with the management. This book
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>consists, in the main, of the broad study of railway favoritism,
which was made as a basis for the generalizations outlined
in the brief chapter on that subject in “The Railways,
the Trusts, and the People,”—one of the thirty chapters
of that book. This study reveals the facts in reference to
railway favoritism or unjust discrimination from the beginning
of our railway history to the present time, discloses
the motives and causes of discrimination, discusses various
remedies that have been proposed, and gathers hints from
the railway systems of other countries to clarify and develop
the conclusions indicated by our own railroad history.</p>

<p class='c007'>Special acknowledgments are due to Dr. Taylor, who paid
a part of the cost of the special investigations on which the
book is based and has taken a keen interest in the progress
of the work from its inception, and also to Mr. Ralph
Albertson, who has worked almost constantly with the
writer for the past eight months and more or less for
two years before that, and has rendered great assistance in
research, in consultation and criticism, and in the checking
and revision of proof.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='large'>THE LAW AND THE FACT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is a principle of the common law that common carriers
must be impartial. “They cannot legally give undue
or unjust preferences, or make unequal or extravagant
charges.... They are bound to provide reasonable and
sufficient facilities. They must not refuse to carry any
goods or passengers properly applying for transportation....
They have no right to grant monopolies or special
privileges or unequal preferences, but are bound to treat
all fairly and impartially.”<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> That is the rule of the common
law which represents the crystallized common-sense
and practical conscience of the Anglo-Saxon and every
other civilized race. The legal principle that a common
carrier must be impartial was established long before the
Interstate Commerce Act was passed, or the Granger laws
enacted,—yes, before railways or steamboats were born.
They inherited the family character and the family law.
It has been applied to them in innumerable cases. There
is a solid line of decisions from the infancy of the English
law to the present time. Constitutional provisions and
State and Federal statutes have been passed to affirm and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>enforce the rule. The railroads themselves declare the
rule to be right. And yet, in spite of the railway conscience
and the common law, the universal sense of justice
of mankind, and the whole legislative, executive, and judicial
power of the government, the rule is not obeyed. On
the contrary, disregard of it is chronic and contagious, and
constitutes one of the leading characteristics of our railway
system. In spite of law and justice our railway practice
is a tissue of unfair discrimination, denying the small
man equal opportunity with the rich and influential, and
breaking the connection between merit and success.</p>

<p class='c007'>The railways unjustly favor persons, places, and commodities,
and they do it constantly, systematically, habitually.
If every instance of unjust discrimination that occurs
to-day were embodied in human form and the process were
continued for a year,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> the outlaw host would dwarf the
Moslem hordes that deluged southern Europe in the days
of Charles Martel, outnumber many fold the Grand Army
of the Republic in its palmiest days, and, shoulder to shoulder,
the dark and dangerous mob would reach across the
continent, across the ocean, over Europe and Asia, and
around the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The railways discriminate partly because they wish to,
and partly because they have to. The managers favor
some interests because they are linked with the interests
of the railways or the managers, and they favor some other
interests because they are forced to. The pressure of private
interest is stronger than the pressure of the law, and
so the railroad manager fractures his conscience and breaks
the statutes and common law into fragments.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>PASSES AND POLITICS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One of the most important forms of discrimination is
the railroad pass. Many persons of wealth or influence,
legislators, judges, sheriffs, assessors, representatives of
the press, big shippers, and agents of large concerns, get
free transportation, while those less favored must pay not
only for their own transportation, but for that of the
railway favorites also.</p>

<p class='c007'>A farmer and a lawyer occupied the same seat in a railroad
car. When the conductor came the farmer presented
his ticket, and the lawyer a pass. The farmer did not conceal
his disgust when he discovered that his seat-mate was
a deadhead. The lawyer, trying to assuage the indignation
of the farmer, said to him: “My friend, you travel very
cheaply on this road.” “I think so myself,” replied the
farmer, “considering the fact that I have to pay fare for
both of us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The free-pass system is specially vicious because of its
relation to government. Passes are constantly given to
public officials in spite of the law, and constitute one of
the most insidious forms of bribery and corruption yet invented.
I have in my possession some photographs of
annual passes given by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1903,
1904, and 1905 to members of the State Legislature, and
the Common Council of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Constitution of Pennsylvania, Section 8 of Article 8,
says: “No railroad, railway, or other transportation company,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>shall grant free passes, or passes at a discount, to any
persons except officers or employees of the company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The question is whether the members of the Legislature
are employees of the Pennsylvania Railroad.</p>

<p class='c007'>Recently the Pennsylvania Railroad gave notice that
after January 1, 1906, no free passes would be issued except
to employees. As we have seen reason to believe, this
may still include members of the Legislature, and even if
the order should happen to be enforced according to the
common acceptation of the word “employees,” there are
plenty of ways in which free transportation can be given
to men the railroad management deems it desirable to
favor. Railroads have made such orders before, and in
every case the fact has proved to be that the order simply
constituted an easy method of lopping off the overgrown
demand for passes, a ready excuse for denying requests
the railroad does not wish to honor, without in the least
interfering with its power of favoring those it really wishes
to favor. In cutting off passes under said order to multitudes
of city officials in Pittsburg lately the Pennsylvania
railroad officers stated that the demand had become so
great that those having free rides were actually crowding
the paying passengers on many of the trains. The <cite>Philadelphia
North American</cite> declared that in that city every
big and little politician expected free passage when he requested
it, and that there was no ward heeler so humble that
he might not demand transportation for himself and friends
to Atlantic City, Harrisburg, or any other point on the
Pennsylvania line. The <cite>Springfield Republican</cite> said: “It
does not appear to be recognized, in the praise given to the
present action of the railroad company, how great an impeachment
of its management the old order constituted.
We are told that passes were issued literally in bundles for
the use of political workers, big and little.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We watched with much interest to see what the railroad
would really do when the time for full enforcement of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>order came. In Pennsylvania, as was anticipated, the order
has been used as a basis for refusing passes to the overgrown
horde of grafters who have feasted so long at the Pennsylvania’s
tables. The railway does not want anything this
year in Pennsylvania that the grafters can give it, and it is
an excellent opportunity to punish the Pittsburg politicians
for allowing the Gould lines to enter the city. But in Ohio
the situation is different, and, in spite of the recent order,
the time-honored free passes have been sent to every
member of the Ohio Legislature. A press despatch from
Columbus, January 1, says: “One of the notable events
that marked the opening of the general assembly to-day was
the unexpected arrival of railroad passes for every member.
The Pennsylvania, first to announce that the time-honored
graft would be cut off, was the first to send the little
tickets, and the other lines followed suit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Pennsylvania is not alone in its delicate generosity
to legislators and other persons of influence. The <em>practice</em>
is <em>practically</em> universal.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> From Maine to California there
is not a State in which the railroads refrain from giving
passes to legislators, judges, mayors, assessors, etc. And
the roads expect full value for their favors. Some time
ago a member of the Illinois Legislature applied to the
president of a leading railroad for a pass. In reply he
received the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your letter of the 22nd to President ——, requesting an
annual over the railroad of this company, has been referred
to me. A couple of years ago, after you had been furnished
with an annual over this line, you voted against a bill
which you knew this company was directly interested in.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Do you know of any particular reason, therefore, why we
should favor you with an annual this year?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads give passes to legislators and public officials
not, as a rule, in any spirit of philanthropy or respect for
public office, but as a matter of business; and if a legislator
does not recognize the obligation that adheres to the pass,
the pass is not likely to adhere to him in subsequent years.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many cases the pass is the first step on the road to
railroad servitude. Governor Folk said to me: “The railroads
debauch legislators at the start by the free pass. It
is a misdemeanor by the law of this State to take such a
favor.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> But it seems so ordinary a thing that the legislator
takes it. He may start out with good intentions, but
he takes a pass and then the railroad people have him in
their power. He has broken the law, and if he does not do
as they wish they threaten to publish the number of his
pass. He generally ends by taking bribe money. He’s in
the railroad power anyway to a certain extent, and thinks
he might as well make something out of it. In investigating
cases of corruption I have found that in almost every
instance the first step of the legislator toward bribery was
the acceptance of a railroad pass.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the annual dinner of the Boston Merchants’ Association,
January, 1906, Governor Folk said: “One of our
greatest evils is the domination of public affairs by our
great corporations, and we will never get rid of corporation
dominance till we get rid of the free pass. That is the
insidious bribe that carries our legislators over the line
of probity. First seduced by the free pass, destruction is
easy. No legislator has a right to accept a free pass; no
more right than to accept its equivalent in money.” Even
the laws against the free pass, Governor Folk says, often
play into the hands of the railways and emphasize and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>fasten corruption upon the State by putting legislators and
officials at the mercy of the railroads in consequence of the
fact that the taking of a pass is a violation of law, so that
the railway has a special hold upon the donee as soon
as the favor is accepted. This is likely to be the effect
unless the law is so thoroughly enforced as to prevent the
taking of passes, which is very difficult and very seldom
achieved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Governor Folk is doing his best to abolish the pass evil.
It used to be a common thing for officials of all grades to
ride on passes. And any influential person in Jefferson
City could get a pass by seeing a member of the House or
Senate, who would send a note to Colonel Phelps and a pass
would be forthcoming. Now the legislators decline to
accommodate their friends by making these little requests,
for the matter might come to the ear of Governor Folk.
Moreover the government employees in Missouri have been
cut off from these railroad “courtesies.” The statute does
not apply to appointive officers, but the Governor does not
intend that his department shall be honeycombed with railroad
influence if he can help it. One of the officers of a
subordinate branch of the government went to him and
asked him about the matter. “I do not want a pass for
myself,” said the interrogator, “but Mr. W. told me that he
would like for me to see you before he accepted a pass and
see if you had any objections. And I want to add, Governor,
that it has always been the custom for the employees
in this department to use free passes.” Governor Folk’s
countenance lost its smile for the moment, as he said very
slowly and sternly: “Tell the employees of your department
that if any of my appointees ride upon railway passes
they will be instantly discharged.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These insidious bribes in the guise of courtesy and honor
for position—these free passes which Governor Folk denounces
as the first steps to corruption—are prevalent in
all our States. Even in honest old Maine, the frosty forest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>State, I found the railroad pass in full bloom. Speaking to
a joint committee of the House and Senate at Augusta a
few months ago, I exhibited a number of photographs of
passes given to legislators and councilmen by one of our
big railroads. The members examined these photos with
much interest and some facetious remarks. On the way
into town a famous lobbyist who has long and close acquaintance
with the legislature of Maine laughed till the
tears ran down his cheeks over the memory of the scene,
puffing out between his explosions the explanation of his
merriment: “Every one of those fellows has a railroad pass
in his own pocket.” Inquiry in other directions tends to
confirm his statement.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hardly possible to imagine that the ordinary legislator
or judge can be entirely impartial in reference to a
railroad bill or suit when he is under obligation to the railroads
for past favors and hopes for similar courtesies in the
future.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a judge finds that jurors in a railroad case have
accepted passes from the railroad he discharges the jurors
as unfit for impartial service,<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> yet that same judge may
have in his pocket an annual pass over all the lines of the
road that is plaintiff or defendant in the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some railroad presidents and managers have told me that
passes are given as mere courtesies and are not intended to
influence the conduct of officials. This may be true in some
cases, but as a rule the railroads do not give charity; but
expect favor for favor, and value for value, or multiplied
value for value. Railroad men have sometimes admitted
to me that the psychology of the pass is closely related to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>that of the bribe, and that they sought and obtained political
results from the distribution of transportation favors.
And aside from such admissions the evidence on the facts
is overwhelming.</p>

<p class='c007'>A prominent judge who had been on the bench for years
in one of our best States and had always received passes
from various railroad companies, found at the beginning of
a new year that one of the principal railroads had failed to
send him the customary pass. Thinking it an oversight he
called the attention of the railroad’s chief attorney to the
fact. “Judge,” said the lawyer, “did you not recently
decide an important case against our company?” “And
was not my decision in accordance with law and justice?”
said the judge. The attorney did not reply to this, but a
few days later the judge got his pass. After some months
it again became the duty of the judge to render a decision
against the company. This second act of judicial independence
was not forgiven. The next time he presented
his pass the conductor confiscated it in the presence of
many passengers and required the judge to pay his fare.</p>

<p class='c007'>The railroad commission in one of our giant States says
the fact “that for the most part passes are given to official
persons for the purpose of influencing official conduct,
is made manifest by the fact that they are not given to
such persons except while they hold official positions.”<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The president of an important railroad is stated to have
said that he “saved his company thousands of dollars a
year by giving annual passes to county auditors.” And
a man who had been auditor for many years said that the
taxes of the —— railroad company were increased about
$20,000 a year because it was so stingy with its passes.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Members of legislatures and of Congress have told me
that after voting against railroad measures the usual passes
were not forthcoming.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little while before the introduction of the rate legislation
now pending, in pursuance of President Roosevelt’s
regulative policy, a congressman from the Far West was
visiting with us. He had free transportation for himself
and family anywhere in the United States any time he
wanted it. A lady in the family asked him if it was the
same way with the rest of the congressmen, and he said
“Yes.” I have in my notes conversations with senators
and representatives from eighteen States, and all of them
stated, in reply to my questions, that passes were an established
and regular part of the perquisites of a member of
Congress.</p>

<p class='c007'>But since the Esch-Townsend bill for the fixing of rates
by a government commission came on deck, I understand
that the congressmen who supported it are learning the
lesson conveyed in the pass-denying letter above quoted, as
some of the railroads are refusing all the requests of such
congressmen for free transportation. The president of one
of these railroads is reported to have said: “I never was
in favor of granting political transportation, and now I have
a good opportunity to cut off some of these deadheads.
Transportation has been given them in the past on the
theory that they were friends, but when we needed friends
they were not there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This, however, is only a passing phase—an emergency
measure to punish a few congressmen who have shown so
little appreciation of the right of the railroads to make the
laws affecting transportation, that they actually voted for
what they deemed right or for what the people desired,
rather than for what the railroads wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aside from such little eddies, the great stream of dead-headism
flows on as smooth and deep as ever. The people
take the thing so much as a matter of course that it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>been a constant cause of surprise to passengers on the New
York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad to see Governor
Douglas pay his fare day by day as he travelled to and fro
on an ordinary commutation ticket.</p>

<p class='c007'>A prominent judge of Chicago tells me that for years
the leading railroads entering that city have sent him
annual passes without request. I found the same thing in
Denver, San Francisco, New York, Boston, and nearly
everywhere else I have been in this country. The mayor
of one of our giant cities told me this very morning that
the principal railroads sent him annuals but he returned
them. It would be better if he would turn the next lot
over to a publicity league or put them in a museum.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many cases the railroads are practically forced to give
passes. A. B. Stickney, President of the Chicago and
Great Western Railroad was asked by the Industrial Commission<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
about the giving of passes to members of the
judiciary of Minnesota and Illinois. President Stickney
said, “If any of them ask for transportation, they get it;
we don’t hesitate to give to men of that class if they ask
for passes; we never feel at liberty to refuse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is there any good reason why a judge who gets a good
salary should have a pass—any greater reason than why
John Smith should have a pass?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That depends,” said President Stickney, “on what you
call a good reason.... Twenty-five years ago I had
charge of a little bit of a road that was a sort of subordinate
of a larger road.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had occasion to visit the president of the superior road
about something, and he said: ‘Mr. Stickney, I see that
the sheriff of this county has a pass over your road. I
should like to know on what principle you gave that
sheriff a pass.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I did it on the principle that he was a power, and I
was afraid to refuse him,’ I said.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“‘Well,’ said he, ‘I refused him.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You will wish you hadn’t before the year is over,’ I
replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sometime afterwards, and during the year, I went into
the office to see the superintendent, but he was not in; I
went into the general freight agent’s office, and he was not
in; I went into the general manager’s office, and he was
not in. So I then went into the office of the president and
said, ‘What kind of a road have you got? Your superintendent
is not here, your general freight agent is not here,
and your general manager is not here.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“He hung his head down and said: ‘Do you remember
that conversation we had about that sheriff’s pass? He’s
got all those men on the jury and has got them stuck for
about two weeks.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Q. “That answer seems to indicate that railroads would
be afraid to refuse for fear of the penalties?”</p>

<p class='c007'>A. “I think the railroads find there is a class of men
that it is to their interest not to refuse if they ask for
passes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Van Oss says that at one time in this country half the
passengers rode on passes.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> That seems incredible. There
is no doubt, however, that the pass evil was enormous
before it was checked by State and Federal legislation, and
still prevails to an astonishing extent. Six years after the
Interstate Act prohibited all preferences, and twenty years
after the State crusade against passes and other discriminations
began, C. Wood Davis, a railway auditor of large
experience, and an executive officer having authority to
issue passes, stated that “ten percent of the railway travel
of this country is free, the result being that the great mass
of railway users are yearly mulcted some $33,000,000 for
the benefit of the favored few. No account of these passes
is rendered to State, nation, or the confiding stockholders.”<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>If ten percent still ride deadhead, as is quite probable,
the resulting tax upon paying railway users is now over
$50,000,000 a year. The effect of legislation has been to
give the railways an excuse for shutting off the less influential
of the former deadheads, while the big people ride
free in spite of the law.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Hon. Martin A. Knapp, Chairman of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, says: “A gentleman told me that
on one occasion he came from Chicago to Washington
along in the latter days of November, and every passenger
in the Pullman car, besides himself, was a member of Congress
or other Government official, with their families, and
that he was the only passenger who paid a cent for transportation
from Chicago to Washington, either for his
passage or for his Pullman car.”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Morton says: “Passes are given for many reasons,
almost all of which are bad.... Passes are given for
personal, political, and commercial reasons.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Big shippers and their agents get them as a premium on
or inducement to shipments over the donating railroad.
When we went to the St. Louis Exposition we had to pay
our fare, but the shipping manager of a large firm I have
in mind was given free transportation for himself and
family, though he was abundantly able to pay. In fact,
those best able to pay ride free, while the poor have to
pay for the rich as well as for themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>One way in which the railway managers evade the Interstate
Commerce Law, in giving passes to large shippers and
others, is to designate the recipients as employees of their
own or other companies.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>President Stickney, of the Chicago and Great Western
Railroad, said in a recent address before the Washington
Economic Society:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“The law which makes it a misdemeanor for any individual
not an officer of a railway company to use a pass
was enacted by Congress and approved by the President
18 years ago, and as an individual rule of action it was
ignored by the congressmen who passed it and by the President
who approved it; and subsequent congressmen and
presidents, with rare exceptions, have ignored its provisions.
Travelling, they present the evidence of their
misdemeanor before the eyes of the public in a way which
indicates no regard for the law. The governors of the
States, many of the judges,—in short, all officialdom from
the highest to the lowest,—the higher clergy, college professors,
editors, merchants, bankers, lawyers, present the
evidence of their misdemeanor in the same manner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As we shall see presently, there are other forms of passenger
discrimination, such as the free private car, the rate
war, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>But neither of these nor the selling of tickets below the
normal rates through scalpers, constitutes so inequitable or
dangerous a form of discrimination as the pass system. As
Hadley says: “The really serious form of passenger discrimination
is the free-pass system. It is a serious thing,
not so much on account of the money involved, as on account
of the state of the public morals which it indicates
(and develops). When passes are given as a matter of
mere favoritism, it is bad enough. When they are given
as a means of influencing legislation, it is far worse. Yet
this last form of corruption has become so universal that
people cease to regard it as corrupt. Public officials and
other men of influence are ready to expect and claim free
transportation as a right. To all intents and purposes they
use their position to levy blackmail against the railroad
companies.”<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Other leading countries are not afflicted with this pass
disease to any such extent as we are; some of them do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>have the malady at all. In France and Italy I was offered
passes, but the government roads of Austria, Germany,
and Belgium not only did not offer passes, but refused to
grant them even when considerable pressure was brought to
bear.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> The Minister of Railways in Austria informed
me that he had no pass himself, but paid his fare like any
ordinary traveller. No amount of personal or official pull
could secure free transportation. The same thing I found
was true in Germany. Only railway employees whose
duty calls them over the road have passes. The Minister
pays when he travels on his own account. And the Emperor
also pays for his railway travel. It is the settled
policy of government roads in all enlightened countries to
treat all customers alike so far as possible, concessions
being made, if at all, to those who cannot afford to pay
or who have some claim on the ground of public policy: as
in South Africa where children are carried free to school; in
New Zealand, where men out of work are taken to places
where they may find employment, on credit or contingent
payment; and in Germany and other countries, where
tickets are sold at half price for the working-people’s trains
in and out of the cities morning and night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even in England, though the roads are private like ours,
the working-people have cheap trains, and public officials
pay full fare. The King of England pays his fare when
travelling, and if he has a special train he pays regular rates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>for that too. Members of Parliament also and minor public
officers pay for transportation. Passes are not given for
political reasons. The law against this class of discriminations
is thoroughly enforced. But in this country not
only members of Congress and other public officials, but
some of our presidents even have subjected themselves to
severe criticism by accepting free transportation in disregard
of Federal law.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>PASSENGER REBATES AND OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION IN PASSENGER TRAFFIC.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In addition to the passengers who travel free on passes,
there are many who have free transportation in other forms.
One method of favoritism is the payment of rebates, which
are in use in the passenger departments as well as in the
freight departments of our railroads. Passenger rebates
are repayments of a part or the whole of the amounts paid
by favored parties for tickets or mileage. For example,
large concerns that employ travelling men buy ordinary
passenger mileage books, and when the mileage is used
the cover of the book is returned to the railroad and a
refund is made.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> In the investigation of the Wisconsin
railroads, instituted by Governor La Follette in 1903, it
was found that every railroad of importance in the State
had been paying passenger rebates in large amounts every
year for the whole six years that were covered by the
search. From 1897 to the end of 1903 the Chicago, Milwaukee
and St. Paul refunded $170,968 in passenger rebates,
the Chicago and Northwestern refunded $614,361;
adding the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha, the
Wisconsin Central, and the “Soo Line,” the total passenger
rebates paid by the five roads named in the said time was
over $972,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of some favored shippers in Wisconsin it
was found that the railroads secretly refunded the entire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>original cost of the mileage books bought by the said shippers
for themselves or their agents, or $60 per book. So
that these favored houses “were able to send out their
entire force of travelling men without paying one cent of
railroad fare, while their competitors paid full fares.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One of these Wisconsin concerns, the Northern Grain
Company, received from the Northwestern Railroad alone
$151,447 rebates in five years, or over $30,000 a year,
partly as refunds on the passenger mileage books of their
travelling men and partly as cash rebates on their business.
The president of the Northern Grain Company is O. W.
Mosher, who was a State senator in 1901 and 1903 and
fought the railroad reforms proposed by Governor La
Follette. He vigorously defended “individual liberty”
and the right of the railroads to “control their own property,”
and it is easy to understand his earnest opposition
to railroad regulation since it has come out that “individual
liberty” and railroad <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez faire</span></i> meant $30,000 a year
to his company.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><em>The Deadhead Passenger Car.</em></h3>

<p class='c014'>Along with the less-than-carload lots of deadheads travelling
on trip passes or annual passes, or transportation with
a rebate attachment, there are carload lots going deadhead
in private passenger cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a tour to the Pacific coast and back a score of private
cars at different times were attached to the various trains
I was on. A friend who went a year or so later counted
nine private cars on his journey in California, four of them
being attached to the same train at the same time, and in
the whole 9000 miles he travelled the total number of private
cars ran up to 54. Any trust or railroad magnate or
governor of a State may have a private car with his retinue,
while the lesser deadheads ride in the ordinary cars or Pullman
coaches; and the common people pay for it all.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><em>Ticket Scalping.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>For many years the railroads aided and abetted the ticket
scalpers, paying commissions on the sale of tickets,<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a> or
making arrangements so that scalpers could get tickets
from the railway offices for less than the regular prices.
Railroad offices have been known to sell tickets systematically
to scalpers at 33, 50, and 66 percent off, or ⅔, ½, and
⅓ of the regular rates. The scalper shared the discount
with the passenger, and the railway prevented some other
line from getting the traffic.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some cases scalpers induced conductors not to cancel
tickets taken up, so that they could be resold in the scalping
offices, the profits being divided with the conductors.
In 10 States where statutes were passed against scalping,
the brokers and the railroads practically nullified the law.
And by collusion with these brokers the railroads secretly
violated the Interstate Commerce Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>A mass of facts upon this subject appears in the expert
testimony pro and con before committees of both Houses
of Congress, notably in January, 1898. It was shown that
at that time 346 newspapers, substantially all the railway
and steamship passenger lines of the United States, the
laws of 10 States, the long example of Canada, the resolutions
of numerous national, State, and mercantile associations,
the resolutions of the railway commissioners of
19 States, the insistent and repeated views of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, the lesson taught by every other
railway country of the earth, the due protection of the
large organizations to whom special fares are granted and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of the railways granting them, the due observance of law,
and the best moral sense of all the commercial world, were
all arrayed on the honest side of every phase of this question.
Ticket brokerage was defended by not over 3 railroads
and 560 ticket brokers. The two organized bodies
of scalpers, the American Ticket Brokers’ Association and
the Guarantee Ticket Brokers’ Association, stood behind
the scalping business.</p>

<p class='c007'>George R. Blanchard, former commissioner of the Joint
Traffic Association, says in his testimony before the United
States Industrial Commission (IV, 623): “There are two
organized bodies of scalpers: the American Ticket Brokers’
Association and the Guarantee Ticket Brokers’ Association.
They have their directors, officers, and agents,
rules and regulations, and they adopt resolutions and discuss
and decide questions of cut fares.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One railroad president told me that most of the tickets
the scalpers sold they got directly from the railroads.
Another railroad president has given similar testimony
before the Industrial Commission, and also stated that
he did not believe the railroads could stop the scalping
trade in unused tickets.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This method of discrimination has, however, received a
serious setback so far as railway collusion is concerned.
The presidents of the leading railroads have agreed with
each other to support the law, and scalping is a more limited
profession than it formerly was. In fact, a much
larger claim than this is made by some. In going over
this year the materials I have collected on the subject, I
came upon the statement that “scalping has been practically
abolished.” I put up my pen and went down town
to see. I found on Washington Street (Boston), in the
ticket-office district, a man with “Cut Rates” printed in
large letters on his back. The same sign was above a
door near by, and on the stairway. I went up.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“What will it cost me to go to Chicago?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can give you a ticket for $12 if you are going within
a few days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose I don’t go for a month or two?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I can give you a $15 rate most any time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“First-class?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Over what route?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Boston &amp; Maine and Grand Trunk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can you do over the Boston &amp; Albany?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll give you transportation on that route for $18.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will that be first-class?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tourist?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you have the $12 tickets often?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sometimes; but I can give you a $15 rate any time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I went to the railway ticket offices and learned that the
fare from Boston to Chicago by the Boston &amp; Maine and
Grand Trunk was $18 first-class, and $17 tourist; by the
Boston &amp; Albany $22 first-class, and $19 tourist, and
through New York $25.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is clear, therefore, that scalping is not a lost art. The
regular one-price ticket agents say that the cut-rate business
is still in flourishing condition. It may be that railway
offices no longer act with scalpers to evade the law,
but when a scalper says he will give you a first-class ticket
(worth $18 at the depot) for $15 any time you want it, it
looks as though he had some pretty certain source of
supply. One scalper here, I am told, is the brother of the
advertising manager of a monthly magazine. Railroads
advertising in the magazines pay in tickets and the manager
turns these tickets over to the scalper. The same
thing is done in New York and Chicago, and probably in
other places. Scalpers also get unused portions of excursion
and other tickets. And perhaps some of the railways
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>are still in direct collusion with scalpers. Every freight
pool or agreement to prevent cutting freight rates that was
ever made was broken by some railroad secretly cutting
prices, and it may be that an agreement to maintain fares is
not safe against secret cutting either.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most peculiar things about scalping is that,
unlike other forms of discrimination, its benefits go to the
poor man instead of the rich man. It is the only kind of
discrimination that gives the poor man any comfort or tends
to diffuse wealth instead of concentrating it. In this one
case the rich help to pay for the poor man’s transportation;
in all other cases the poor man and the man of moderate
wealth help to pay for the service the rich man gets. Perhaps
this partly explains why it is that many railroads have
taken a more decided stand against this abuse than against
any other in the long list of evils that afflict transportation
in this country.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>FREIGHT DISCRIMINATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We come now to a kind of discrimination that enables a
railway manager to determine which of the merchants,
manufacturers, mine owners, etc., on his line shall prosper
and which shall not; what cities and towns shall grow,
what States shall thrive, what industries shall be developed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The purpose of discrimination may be (1) to keep business
from going to a competing line; (2) to increase revenue
by creating new business for which, if necessary, rates may
be dropped very low, as anything above the cost of handling
on new business will add to income; (3) to simplify and
solidify traffic; (4) to favor persons who, through political
influence or other power may aid or injure the road, or who,
through friendship, marriage, business or civic relation, or
otherwise, have a “pull” with the management; (5) to
advance the interests or enhance the value of a business, or
property, or place, in which the railway or its officers or
their friends are interested; or (6) to kill or injure a place
or person or business that has incurred the enmity of the
railways or their allies.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a result of the play of these motives our railroad
history is full of unfair discriminations between persons,
places, and industries in the United States, and between
domestic and foreign trade. The methods and forms are
many and have grown more numerous with each succeeding
epoch, but the predominant forms vary in the different
strata. We still have plenty of living specimens of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>species that prevailed in earlier periods, but the leading
forms now are comparatively recent evolutions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of discriminations would fill many volumes.
The Hepburn Committee (1879) appointed by the New
York Legislature collected about 5000 cases of discrimination.
It was shown to be a common thing for railroads to
give favored shippers discounts of 50, 60, 70, and even 80
percent from the regular rates. The special contracts
involving favors in force for one year on a single railroad,
the New York Central, were estimated at 6000. The
United States Senate Committee of 1885, the Congressional
Committee of 1888, the Interstate Commerce Commission,
1887–1905, the United States Industrial Commission, 1900–1902,
the Wisconsin investigation in the fall of 1903, the
United States Senate Committee of 1905, the State railroad
commissions, the courts, and other investigating bodies
have brought to light additional thousands of discriminations.
We shall select some examples illustrating various
methods of discrimination.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>THE EARLY YEARS, HEPBURN REPORT, ETC.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One of the discriminations most complained of in early
years was the charging of lower rates for a long haul than
for a short haul on the same line—less for the whole than
for a part.</p>

<p class='c007'>For example, the rate from New York to Ogden was $4.65
per hundred, while $2.25 per hundred carried the same
freight all the way from New York to San Francisco. The
railroads charged more if the car stopped part way than if
it went on to the Pacific,—more than twice as much, in
fact, for the part haul as for the full distance, so that the
extra charge for not hauling the car on from Ogden to
Frisco was greater than for hauling it the entire distance
from ocean to ocean. They seemed to be willing to take
off half for the privilege of hauling the car another 1000
miles. These methods are still in practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The C. B. &amp; Q. hauled stock from points beyond the
Missouri River to Chicago for $30 a car, while charging $70
a car on much shorter hauls to points in Iowa. The Northern
Pacific charged twice as much from New York to points
a hundred miles or more east of Portland, as from New
York clear through to Portland. Freight was shipped from
New York State to Council Bluffs and then back to Atlantic,
Iowa, 60 miles west of Council Bluffs on the Rock
Island, for less than the charge direct to Atlantic. From
Chicago to Kankakee, 56 miles, the Illinois Central charged
16 cents per cwt. for fourth-class goods, while it carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the same goods to Mattoon, 116 miles farther on, for 10
cents per cwt. The grain rate on the Pennsylvania Railroad
from Chicago to Pittsburg was 25 cents in 1878, while
the same road would carry the grain clear through from
Chicago to New York for 15 cents. Glassware paid 28
cents a hundred from Pittsburg to Chicago, and only 14
cents from Philadelphia to Chicago, half the rate for nearly
double the distance. A tub of butter from Elgin, Ill., to
New York, 1000 miles, paid 30 cents, while the freight on
the same tub from points 165 miles out of New York City
was 75 cents. The railways put the farmers of Western
New York further from market than their competitors in
the West. By such arrangements as this it was claimed the
railroads had caused a depreciation of $400,000,000 in
the value of improved lands in New York, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware, while the area of
improved lands in those States had increased 4,500,000
acres.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The evils of unjust rates and railway favoritism for persons
and places were earnestly discussed in the press, and
in State legislatures, and in Congress. One of the examples
of discrimination that caused much discussion in Congress
was the Winona case. Cotton paid $1 a bale from Memphis
to New Orleans, 450 miles; from Winona to New
Orleans, 275 miles, travelling possibly in the same train
with the Memphis bales, the rate was $3.25 per bale.
Another example adduced in Congress was the 75 cent rate
from New York to New Orleans, while points half way paid
$1.00 for the same service.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><em>The Granger Laws.</em></h3>

<p class='c014'>In the early seventies (1872 and following years), Iowa,
Nebraska, Minnesota, Kansas, and other States of the Middle
West passed what are known as the “Granger laws,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>fixing maximum rates and forbidding discriminations.
Railroad commissions were also established in these States
to control the roads, and it was hoped that these commissions,
which grew out of the Granger agitation and were to
represent the public interest and the people’s sovereignty in
their relations with the railways, would be able to diminish
greatly and perhaps abolish unjust discriminations.
In this hope, however, the people were disappointed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking of this experience Governor Larrabee of Iowa
said in 1893: “Every year seemed to add to the grievances
of the public. Success greatly emboldened the railway
companies. Discriminations seemed to increase in number
and gravity. At many points in the western part of the
State freight rates to Chicago were from 50 to 75 percent
higher than from points in Kansas and Nebraska. A car
of wheat hauled only across the State paid twice as much
freight as another hauled twice the distance from its point
of origin to Chicago. Minnesota flour was hauled a distance
of 300 miles for a less rate than Iowa flour was carried
100 miles. Certain merchants received from the railroad
companies a discount of 50 percent on all their freights,
and thus were enabled to undersell all their competitors.
The rate on coal in carload lots from Cleveland, Lucas
County, to Glenwood was $1.80 per ton, and from the same
point to Council Bluffs only $1.25, although the latter was
about thirty miles longer haul. Innumerable cases of this
kind could be cited. There was not a town or interest in
the State that did not feel the influence of these unjust
practices.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'><em>The Hepburn Investigation.</em></h3>

<p class='c014'>This most famous and enlightening investigation of the
early period was that of the Hepburn Committee of New
York in 1879. The committee found that many shippers
were paying two or three times, and in some cases five times,
the rates paid by their rivals.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>William H. Vanderbilt told the committee that, as a
rule, all large shippers who asked for special rates got them.
Among the men his road had helped to build up by special
rates was A. T. Stewart, the great dry-goods merchant of
New York. He had a rate of 13 cents from his factories
over the New York Central to New York, while small concerns
paid 20 to 40 cents for this same service. A big
dealer in cotton cloth had a 20 cent rate, while others paid
the regular 35 and 40 cent rate. Five grocery firms in
Syracuse had a flat 9 cent rate instead of the published
tariff of 37, 29, 25, and 18 cents, according to the class of
goods. Four Rochester firms had a special rate of 13 cents
against the regular tariff of 40, 30, 25, and 20 cents. Five
firms at Binghamton and five at Elmira had rates from ⁵⁄₉
to ⅓ of the tariff. Three Utica dry-goods merchants had a
rate of 9 cents and another had a rate of 10 cents, while
the regular rates which the outside public paid were 33, 26,
and 22 cents, according to class. Soap shipped by B. of
New York to C. of Syracuse cost 12 cents freight per box
if the freight was paid by the shipper in New York, but
only 8 cents a box if the freight was paid by the consignee
in Syracuse.</p>

<p class='c007'>A report of the Erie Railroad showed 34 cases of special
cut rates, and a New York Central report showed 33 examples.
The books of the Central showed 6000 special rates
granted during the first 6 months of 1880. About 90 percent
of the Syracuse business and 50 percent of the entire
business of the road was done on special rates.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a> It had
given special rates to individuals and firms at 22 points on
its line between Albany and Buffalo. The specials generally
went down to about ⅓ of the scheduled rates to the same
place, but in Syracuse a special agreement was unearthed
in which the rate was so emaciated as to be only ⅕ of the
size of the regular rate on first-class goods to which it
applied.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The committee also found the long-haul discrimination
in full bloom. Flour went from Milwaukee to New York
for 20 cents, while the charge from Rochester to New York
was 30 cents. On some goods the rate from New York to
Syracuse, 291 miles, was 10 cents; New York to Little Falls,
217 miles, 20 cents; New York to Black Rock, 445 miles,
20 cents also. Syracuse must have had a strange fascination
for the railroad men, to keep them from making a
lower rate from the point 400 miles away than from the
point 200 miles away, for they love long hauls. Goods
were shipped from Rochester to New York and then from
New York back over the same road through Rochester to
Cincinnati more cheaply than they could be sent direct
from Rochester to Cincinnati. W. W. Mack, a Rochester
manufacturer, testified that he saved 14 cents a hundred in
this way, and that he saved 18 cents a hundred in his
St. Louis business in the same way. In both these cases
the railroad company carried the goods 700 miles farther
than the direct course for a charge considerably less than
for the direct haul.</p>

<p class='c007'>Butter was carried from St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., to
Boston for 60 cents a hundred, while the rate from nearer
stations was 70 cents, 80 cents, and even 90 cents at St.
Albans, Vt., increasing as the distance decreased. The
railroads appear to recognize the fact that happiness consists
in the exercise of the faculties, and they wish to exercise
their faculties to the utmost by securing long hauls
even though the long rate may not leave nearly so much
profit as the rate for the short haul.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the worst discriminations of the early years
were those connected with the oil business.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a> In 1872 the
Oil Combine (then called the South Improvement Co.)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>secured a secret agreement from all the railroads running
into the oil regions, first, to double freight rates on oil;
second, not to charge the S. I. C. the increase; third, to
pay the S. I. C. the increase collected from all other
shippers. The rate to Cleveland was to be raised to 80
cents, except for the S. I. C., which continued to pay 40,
and would receive 40 of the 80 paid by any one else. The
rate to Boston was raised to $3, and the S. I. C. would
receive $1.32 of it. The Combine was to have 40 cents to
$1.32 a barrel rebate not only on their own oil which constituted
only one-tenth of the business, but on all the oil
their competitors shipped, so they would get $9 in rebates
for every dollar they paid in freight. The S. I. C. were
to receive an average of $1 a barrel on the 18,000 barrels
produced daily in the oil regions. The rates were raised
as agreed, but the excitement in the oil regions was so
intense that mobs would have torn up the tracks of the
railways if Scott and Vanderbilt and the rest had not telegraphed
that the contracts were cancelled, and put the
rates back. But some of the contracts afterwards came
into court, and had not been cancelled at all. In 1874
the roads began gradually to carry out the plan that had
been stopped by popular excitement in 1872.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1874 the Oil Combine had on some lines 10 different
transportation advantages over its competitors, <em>i. e.</em>, 49
cents direct rebate per barrel of refined oil, 22 cents rebate
on crude-oil pipeage, 8½ percent of refined oil carried free
(due to the method of calculating crude and refined equivalents),
13 cents a barrel advantage through possession of
the railroad oil terminal facilities, 15 percent of by-products
carried free, a rate to New York 10 cents a barrel less than
the published rate on refined oil, and 15 cents on crude
oil, exclusive use of tank cars, underbilling of carload
weights, twenty thousand lbs. often for cars containing
forty thousand or even sixty thousand lbs. of oil, or a
lump sum per car regardless of excess weight, and a mileage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>payment from the railroads on the tank cars amounting
in itself to a large rebate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nearly all the refineries of the oil region and of Pittsburg
passed by sale or lease into the hands of the Combine
in 1874–5.</p>

<p class='c007'>W. H. Vanderbilt, and other prominent railroad men
were stockholders in the Standard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank Rockefeller, brother of John D., testified before a
congressional committee July 7, 1876, that he believed
Tom Scott, W. H. Vanderbilt, and other big railroad men
shared in the oil rebates.</p>

<p class='c007'>The New York Central and the Erie sold their terminal
facilities for handling oil to the Standard Oil Co., thereby
making it practically impossible for the roads to transport
oil for the competitors of the Trust. The Pennsylvania
Railroad also, under compulsion of a rate war, made a deal
with the Standard by which the latter acquired the oil
cars, pipe lines, and refineries of the Empire Company, a
creature of the Pennsylvania Railroad.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Vanderbilt told the Hepburn Committee, August 27,
1879, that “if the thing kept on the oil people would own
the roads.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After the Pennsylvania fought the Standard in 1877 and
lost, the Combine paid 11 cents net freight (after deducting
rebate) on each barrel of oil to New York, while its
competitors paid $1.90 per barrel,<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a>—a discrimination of
1600 percent by means of exclusive tank cars and rate
arrangements. The trunk lines would not furnish competitors
of the Standard with tank cars nor give them rates
and conditions that would allow them to use their own
tank cars.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>The independents had to sell their tank cars or side-track
them, because the Oil Combine prevented the railroads from
giving them practical terms. At times when oil could
have been shipped by the independents they could not get
cars, though hundreds were standing idle on the switches.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the independents had to ship their oil in barrels, paying
a higher rate than on tank oil, and paying not only on
the oil, but on eighty lbs. of wood in the barrel, making
four hundred lbs. per barrel instead of three hundred
twenty lbs. per barrel by tank.</p>

<p class='c007'>Josiah Lombard of New York, the largest independent
refiner of oil at the seaboard, testified as follows before the
Hepburn Committee June 23, 1879:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tom Scott, President of the Pennsylvania Railroad
Co., was questioned whether we could have, if there was
any means by which we could have, the same rate of
freight as other shippers got, and he said flatly, ‘No.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“And we asked him then, if we shipped the same amount
of oil as the Standard, and he said, ‘No.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“We said that ‘if they had not sufficient cars to do the
business with we would put on the cars.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Scott said that they would not allow that, and
said that ‘the Standard Oil Co. were the only parties that
could keep peace among the roads.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cassatt, Vice-President, confirms the above and adds:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The discrimination would be larger on a high rate of
freight than a low rate of freight;” also admits that the
“Standard Oil Co. had some 500 cars full here and at
Philadelphia and Baltimore; that he had not discovered it
until recently.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Lombard further testified:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Refineries were thus shut down for want of cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cassatt threatened, if the independents built the
Equitable Pipe Line or any other lines of pipe [as follows]:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Well, you may lay all the pipe lines you like, and we
will buy them up for old iron.’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“R. C. Vilas, General Freight Agent of the Erie (and
brother of Geo. H. Vilas, Auditor of the Standard Oil Co.),
absolutely refused us cars, saying the Standard Oil Co.
had engaged them all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“J. H. Rutter, General Freight Agent, New York Central,
would not furnish any cars, and also said, ‘We have no
terminal facilities now.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>A. J. Cassatt testified before the New York Committee
that in 18 months the Standard Oil had received rebates
amounting to $10,000,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to many other advantages enjoyed by the
Standard people the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1878 gave
the Combine, through the “American Transfer Co.,” a
“commission” of 20 cents a barrel on all shipments of
petroleum,—not only on their own shipments, but on shipments
made by the independents also. At the same time
the New York Central and the Erie were paying the Standard
“commissions” of 20 to 35 cents a barrel on all the
oil shipped over those roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>At one time the transcontinental lines charged $105 to
return an empty “cylinder” tank car from the Pacific
Coast to the Missouri River, while making no charge to
the Standard for returning their “box” tank cars, each of
which contained a cylinder, which, however, was set upright
instead of being placed longitudinally; a distinction without
a difference, but it served to make a discrimination
of over $100 a car in favor of the Trust.</p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads allowed the Oil Trust to stop its cars and
divide up a tank load at two or more stations, but denied
this privilege to the competitors of the Trust.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hepburn Committee reported (1879) that “the
Standard Oil Co. receives rebates from the trunk lines,
ranging from 40 cents to $3.07 a barrel on all oil shipments:
That the trunk lines sell their oil-tank car equipments
to the Standard and agree to build no more: That
the Standard controls the terminal facilities for handling oil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>of the four trunk lines by purchase or lease from the railroads:
That it has frozen out and gathered in refineries of
oil all over the country: That it dictates terms and rates
to the railroads: That the trunk lines have hauled its oil
300 miles for nothing to enable it to undersell seaboard
refineries not then under its control: That it has succeeded
in practically monopolizing the oil business: That the
transactions of the Standard are of such character that its
officers have been indicted, and that its members decline
under oath to give details lest their testimony should be
used to convict them of crime.”<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The oily people were able in one way or another to gain
ascendency over all the railroads. “We made our first contract
with the Standard Oil Company,” said Mr. Cassatt,
“for the reason that we found that they were getting very
strong, and they had the backing of the other roads, and, if
we wanted to retain our full share of the business and get
fair rates on it, it would be necessary to make arrangements
to protect ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Combine used the railroads to ruin its rivals, and did
it with a definiteness and vigor of attack never before attempted,
and with a success that would have been impossible
without the use of the railroad power. An example or
two will make the matter clear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Corrigan, an oil refiner of Cleveland, became so
prosperous in the seventies that he attracted the attention
of the Standard Oil, and in 1877 he began to have trouble.
He could not get the crude oil he bought shipped to Cleveland,
nor his product shipped away, with reasonable promptness.
The railroads refused him cars, and delayed his
shipments after they were loaded. And he was driven to
lease and finally sell his works to the Standard, which had
no difficulty in getting cars and securing prompt service.</p>

<p class='c007'>George Rice became a producer of oil in 1865. A little
later he established a refinery at Marietta, Ohio. In January,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>1879, the freight rates on oil were raised by the railroads
leading out of Marietta, and by their connections.
In some cases the rates were doubled, while the rates from
Cleveland, Pittsburg, Wheeling, and other points where
the Combine had refineries, were lowered. The Baltimore
&amp; Ohio, the Pennsylvania, the Lake Shore, and all the
other railroads involved, made the deal in unison, and after
a secret conference of railway officials with the Standard
Oil people. The change hurt the railroads, cut off their
business in oil from Marietta entirely, but they obeyed the
orders of the Standard nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What would be the inducement?” the freight agent of
the B. &amp; O. connection was asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is a matter I am not competent to answer,” he
replied.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Rice, finding himself shut off from the West, North, and
East, developed new business in the South, but everywhere
he went he was met with new discriminations, and even
refusals in some cases to give him any rates at all. He could
not ship to certain points at any price. In other cases the
oil rates were jumped up for his benefit, and his cars were
delayed or side-tracked by the railroads. Not satisfied with
obstructing and in large part blocking the shipment of refined
oil out of Marietta, the Combine did all it could to
cut off Rice’s supply of crude oil from the wells. It
bought up and destroyed the little pipe line through which
he was getting most of his oil. Rice then turned to the
Ohio fields and brought his oil in by rail over the Cleveland
and Marietta Railroad. Under threat of withdrawing its
patronage the Combine then compelled the road to double
the rates to Rice and pay over to the Combine five-sevenths
of all the freight the road collected on oil. Rice had been
paying 17 cents a barrel from the oil fields to his refinery.
His rate went up to 35 cents while the Combine paid only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>10 and got 25 cents of each 35 paid by Rice.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> “Illegal
and inexcusable abuse,” said Judge Baxter when Rice took
the case into court; and the Senate Committee was also
emphatic in its condemnation. The case is in line with
the whole history of the railroads in their relations with
the Oil Combine, the remarkable fact in this instance being
that the victim had nerve enough to fight the Combine.
He took the facts to the Ohio Legislature, to the courts, to
investigating committees of New York, and Congress, and
rendered a great public service by bringing the ways of
the railroads and the trust to the light of publicity. If all
the victims of the Oil Combine had manifested equal pluck
and public spirit, the evil we are discussing would long
since have ceased to exist.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE SENATE INVESTIGATION OF 1885 AND THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE ACT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In 1885 the United States Senate appointed a committee
to investigate railway discriminations, etc., and this committee
made one of the ablest reports that has ever been
issued in relation to railway abuses. It threw a flood of
light upon the nature and prevalence of discrimination, and
the reasons for it. On page 7 of this report the committee
says that our efficient service and low rates (low average
rates) “have been attained at the cost of the most unwarranted
discriminations, and its effect has been to build up
the strong at the expense of the weak, to give the large
dealer an advantage over the small trader, to make capital
count for more than individual credit and enterprise, to
concentrate business at great commercial centres, to necessitate
combinations and aggregations of capital, to foster
monopoly, to encourage the growth and extend the influence
of corporate power, and to throw the control of the
commerce of the country more and more into the hands of
the few.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On page 40 the committee says: “Railroad companies
are not disposed to regard themselves ‘as holding a public
office and bound to the public,’ as expressed in the ancient
law. They do not deal with all citizens alike. They discriminate
between persons and between places, and the
States and Congress are consequently called on to in some
way enforce the plain principles of the common law for
the protection of the people against the unlawful conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of common carriers in carrying on the commerce of the
country.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On page 188 the following example is given: “One
reference to the testimony must suffice to illustrate the
universality of individual favoritism, the reasons which influence
the railroads in favoring one shipper to the ruin of
another, and the injustice of the system. Mr. C. M. Wicker
of Chicago, a former railroad official of many years’ experience,
was asked if he knew anything of discrimination upon
the part of the transportation companies as between individuals
or localities, and testified as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Wicker.</span> Yes; I do. And this discrimination,
by reason of rebates, is a part of the present railroad system.
I do not believe the present railroad system could
be conducted without it. Roads coming into this field to-day
and undertaking to do business on a legitimate basis
of billing the property at the agreed rates would simply
result in getting no business in a short time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Harris.</span> Then, regardless of the popularly
understood schedule rates, practically it is a matter of
underbidding for business by way of rebates?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Wicker.</span> Yes, sir; worse than that. It is individual
favoritism, the building up of one party to the detriment
of the other. I will illustrate. I have been doing it
myself for years and had to do it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Harris.</span> Doing it for yourself in your
position?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Wicker.</span> I am speaking now of when I was a
railroad man. Here is quite a grain point in Iowa, where
there are 5 or 6 elevators. As a railroad man I would
try and hold all these dealers on a “level keel” and give
them all the same tariff rate. But suppose there was a road
of 5 or 6 or 8 miles across the country, and these dealers
should begin to drop in on me every day or two and tell me
that the road across the country was reaching within a mile
or two of our station and drawing to itself all the grain.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>You might say that it would be the just and right thing to
do to give all the 5 or 6 dealers at this station a special rate to
meet that competition through the country. But as a railroad
man I can accomplish the purpose better by picking
out one good, smart, live man, and giving him a concession
of 3 or 4 cents a hundred, let him go there and scoop the
business. I would get the tonnage, and that is what I want.
But if I give it to the five, it is known in a very short
time.... When you take in these people at the station on
a private rebate you might as well make it public and lose
what you intend to accomplish. You can take hold of one
man and build him up at the expense of the others, and the
railroad will get the tonnage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Harris.</span> The effect is to build the one man
up and destroy the others?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Wicker.</span> Yes, sir; but it accomplishes the purposes
of the road better than to build up the 6.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Harris.</span> And the road, in seeking its own
preservation, has resorted to that method of concentrating
the business into the hands of one or a few, to the destruction
of the many?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Wicker.</span> Yes, sir; and that is a part and parcel
of the system.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On page 189 the committee says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The practice prevails so generally that it has come to
be understood among business men that the published
tariffs are made for the smaller shippers, and those unsophisticated
enough to pay the established rates; that those
who can control the largest amounts of business will be
allowed the lowest rates; that those who, even without this
advantage, can get on ‘the inside,’ through the friendship
of the officials or by any other means, can at least secure
valuable concessions; and that the most advantageous rates
are to be obtained only through personal influence or
favoritism, or by persistent ‘bulldozing.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is in evidence that this state of affairs is far from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>satisfactory, even to those specially favored, who can never
be certain that their competitors do not, or at any time may
not, receive even better terms than themselves. Not a few
large shippers who admitted that they were receiving favorable
concessions testified that they would gladly surrender
the special advantages they enjoyed if only the rates could
be made public and alike to all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, on page 191:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Universal complaint has been made to the committee
as to the discriminations commonly practised against places,
and as to the conspicuous discrepancies between what
are usually termed ‘local’ rates and what are known as
‘through’ rates.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In summing up the testimony on pages 180–182 of their
report, the committee presents this tremendous indictment:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The complaints against the railroad systems of the
United States expressed to the committee are based upon
the following charges:</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. That local rates are unreasonably high, compared
with through rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>“2. That both local and through rates are unreasonably
high at non-competing points, either from absence of competition
or in consequence of pooling agreements that restrict
its operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“3. That rates are established without apparent regard
to the actual cost of the service performed, and are based
largely on what the traffic will bear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“4. That unjustifiable discriminations are constantly
made between individuals, in the rates charged for like
service under similar circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>“5. That improper discriminations are made between
articles of freight and branches of business of a like character,
and between different quantities of the same class of
freight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“6. That unreasonable discriminations are made between
localities similarly situated.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“7. That the effect of the prevailing policy of railroad
management is, by an elaborate system of special secret
rates, rebates, drawbacks, and concessions, to foster monopoly,
to enrich favored shippers, and to prevent free
competition in many lines of trade in which the item of
transportation is an important factor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“8. That such favoritism and secrecy introduce an element
of uncertainty into legitimate business that greatly
retards the development of our industries and commerce.</p>

<p class='c007'>“9. That the secret cutting of rates and the sudden fluctuations
that constantly take place are demoralizing to all
business except that of a purely speculative character, and
frequently occasion great injustice and heavy losses.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'>“14. That the differences in the classifications in use in
various parts of the country, and sometimes for shipments
over the same roads in different directions are a fruitful
source of misunderstandings, and are often made a means
of extortion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“15. That a privileged class is created by the granting
of passes, and that the cost of the passenger service is
largely increased by the extent of this abuse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“16. That the capitalization and bonded indebtedness of
the roads largely exceed the actual cost of their construction
or their present value, and that unreasonable rates are
charged in the effort to pay dividends on watered stock,
and interest on bonds improperly issued.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c007'>“18. That the management of the railroad business is
extravagant and wasteful, and that a needless tax is imposed
upon the shipping and travelling public by the unnecessary
expenditure of large sums in the maintenance of
a costly force of agents engaged in the reckless strife for
competitive business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The result of this investigation and report was the passage
of the Interstate Commerce Act, in 1887, affirming the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>common law rule that carriers’ charges must be reasonable
and impartial. Common carriers are forbidden to give “any
undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any person,
locality, or description of traffic in any respect whatever,
or subject any person, locality or description of
traffic to any undue or unreasonable disadvantage in any
respect whatsoever.” “No common carrier” says Section
2, “shall directly or indirectly, by special rate, rebate,
drawback, or other device, charge or receive from any person
greater or less compensation for any service in the
transportation of passengers or property than it charges or
receives from others for a like and contemporaneous service
under substantially similar circumstances and conditions.”
Section 4 makes it “unlawful to receive more for
a shorter than for a longer distance, including the shorter
on the same line, in the same direction, under substantially
similar circumstances and conditions,” except where the
Commission created by the Act shall authorize the carrier
to charge less for the longer than for the shorter distance.
Rates must be published and filed with the Commission,
and 10 days’ notice must be given of advances. Any deviation
from the published tariff is unlawful. The Act excepted
traffic “wholly within one State,” and provided that
property might be handled free or at reduced rates for the
United States, State, or municipal governments, or for
charitable or exhibition purposes; that preachers might
have reduced rates, and that passes might be given to employees
of the road or by exchange to employees of other
roads. The penalty for breach of the law was made a fine
not exceeding $5000 for each offence, and victims of discrimination,
etc., could collect damages.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A strong Commission was appointed, the Chairman being
Thomas M. Cooley, one of the ablest jurists in the country,
Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court, author of
“Constitutional Limitations” and other works of the highest
authority. The Commission started with a review of
the evils the Interstate Act was intended to abolish, and
entered earnestly upon the great work of enforcing the
law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Commission’s statement of the arrangements used
by the railways for discrimination is so admirably clear
that a part of it cannot fail to be useful here.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These arrangements,” says the Commission, “took the
form of special rates, rebates and drawbacks, underbilling,
reduced classification, or whatever might be best adapted to
keep the transaction from the public; but the public very
well understood that private arrangements were to be had if
the proper motives were presented. The memorandum book
carried in the pocket of the general freight agent often
contained the only record of the rates made to the different
patrons of the road, and it was in his power to place a man
or a community under an immense obligation by conceding
a special rate on one day, and to nullify the effect of it on
the next by doing even better by a competitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Special favors or rebates to large dealers were not
always given because of any profit which was anticipated
from the business obtained by allowing them; there were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>other reasons to influence their allowance. It was early
perceived that shares in railroad corporations were an enticing
subject for speculation, and that the ease with which
the hopes and expectations of buyers and holders could be
operated upon pointed out a possible road to speedy wealth
for those who should have the management of the roads.
For speculative purposes an increase in the volume of business
might be as useful as an increase in net returns; for
it might easily be made to look to those who knew nothing
of its cause like the beginning of great and increasing
prosperity to the road. But a temporary increase was
sometimes worked up for still other reasons, such as to
render plausible some demand for an extension of line or for
some other great expenditure, or to assist in making terms
in a consolidation, or to strengthen the demand for a larger
share in a pool.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whatever was the motive, the allowance of the special
rate or rebate was essentially unjust and corrupting; it
wronged the smaller dealer oftentimes to an extent that
was ruinous, and it was generally accompanied by an
allowance of free personal transportation to the larger
dealer, which had the effect to emphasize its evils. There
was not the least doubt that had the case been properly
brought to a judicial test these transactions would in
many cases have been held to be illegal at the common
law; but the proof was in general difficult, the remedy
doubtful or obscure, and the very resort to a remedy
against the party which fixed the rates of transportation
at pleasure might prove more injurious than the rebate
itself. Parties affected by it, therefore, instead of seeking
redress in the courts, were more likely to direct their
efforts to the securing of similar favors on their own
behalf. They acquiesced in the supposition that there
must or would be a privileged class in respect to rates,
and they endeavored to secure for themselves a place
in it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“Local discriminations, though not at first so unjust and
offensive, have nevertheless been exceedingly mischievous,
and if some towns have grown, others have withered away
under their influence. In some sections of the country if
rates were maintained as they were at the time the interstate
commerce law took effect, it was practically impossible
for a new town, however great its natural advantages,
to acquire the prosperity and the strength which would
make it a rival of the towns which were specially favored
in rates; for the rates themselves would establish for it
indefinitely a condition of subordination and dependence
to ‘trade centres.’ The tendency of railroad competition
has been to press the rates down and still further down
at these trade centres, while the depression at intermediate
points has been rather upon business than upon rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The inevitable result was that this management of
the business had a direct and very decided tendency to
strengthen unjustly the strong among the customers and
to depress the weak. These were very great evils and
the indirect consequences were even greater and more
pernicious than the direct, for they tended to fix in the
public mind a belief that injustice and inequality in the
employment of public agencies were not condemned by
the law, and that success in business was to be sought for
in favoritism rather than in legitimate competition and
enterprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The evils of free transportation of persons were not
less conspicuous than those which have been mentioned.
This, where it extended beyond persons engaged in railroad
service, was actual favoritism in a most unjust and
offensive form. Free transportation was given not only
to secure business, but to gain the favor of localities and
of public bodies; and while it was often demanded by
persons who had, or claimed to have, influence which was
capable of being made use of to the prejudice of the railroads,
it was also accepted by public officers of all grades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and of all varieties of service. In this last case the pass
system was particularly obnoxious and baneful. A ticket
entitling one to free passage by rail was even more effective
in enlisting the assistance and support of the holder
than its value in money would have been, and in a great
many cases it would be received and availed of when the
offer of money made to accomplish the same end would
have been spurned as a bribe. Much suspicion of public
men resulted, and some deterioration of the moral sense
of the community traceable to this cause was unavoidable.
The parties most frequently and most largely favored
were those possessing large means and having large business
interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The general fact came to be that in proportion to the
distance they were carried those able to pay the most paid
the least. One without means had seldom any ground
on which to demand free transportation, while one with
wealth was likely to have many grounds on which he
could make it for the interest of the railroad company to
favor him; and he was oftentimes favored with free transportation
not only for himself and family, but for his business
agents also, and even sometimes for his customers.
The demand for free transportation was often in the
nature of blackmail, and was yielded to unwillingly and
through fear of damaging consequences from a refusal.
But the evils were present as much when it was extorted
as when it was freely given.”<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Commission had plenty to do. Complaints of
unreasonable rates and unjust discriminations between
shippers, commodities, and places poured in upon it,
and vigorous decisions against favoritism and excessive
rates poured out upon the railroads. During 1887 and
1888 the Commission dealt with cases of passes issued
in contravention of law,<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a> preferential fares for drummers,<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a>

commissions to soliciting agents,<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a> etc. Underbilling,
false classification, false weighing, and commissions to
soliciting agents were investigated by the Commission in
1888 at New York, Buffalo, Detroit, Chicago, Omaha, Lincoln,
and Washington.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a> All these methods of discrimination
were found widely prevalent, and new legislation
was asked for imposing a penalty on shippers who fraudulently
obtained reduced rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Congress met for the session of 1889 it was believed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>that the law had greatly reduced the number of
passes issued, straightened out a part of the long-haul discriminations,
and accomplished a good deal in the way
of suppressing rebates, but it was clear that much remained
to be done. In one way or another all over the
country secret discriminations were still being made for
the benefit of favored shippers. Congress therefore in
March, 1889, amended the Interstate Commerce Act by
adding to the fine a penalty of two years’ imprisonment in
the penitentiary in case of unlawful discrimination, and
pronouncing the same penalties against shippers and their
agents who secure advantage by false billing, false classification,
etc., or by soliciting or otherwise inducing a railway
to discriminate in their favor, or by aiding or abetting any
such discriminations. It was also provided that 3 days’
notice must be given in case of any reduction of rates, and
that homeless and destitute persons, as well as preachers,
might be favored with low fares.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stringent provision for imprisonment did not prove
any more effective than the milder law that preceded it,
less so apparently, for the following years were flooded
with unfair discriminations.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>EFFECTS OF THE INTERSTATE ACT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>An investigation by the Commission in May, 1889, concerning
passes, and covering 27 railroads, showed that
passes were issued freely to expressmen, telegraph men,
press men, managers of excursions, attorneys, persons contracting
with the railroads in consideration of advertising,
shippers, members of legislative bodies, United States,
State, and municipal officers, officials of steamship and
steamboat lines, etc. These passes were chiefly limited to
a State, but to some extent were good for interstate journeys.
Of State passes the larger numbers were issued to
members of legislatures and drovers; “complimentaries”
came next, with United States and municipal officers,
newspapermen, and shippers, in the order named.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Commission said: “The Interstate Commerce Act
was intended to end all the abuses attending free transportation
of persons, and to a considerable extent it has done
so. But very largely the carriers, especially the strong
systems, where the abuse has been greatest, have tried to
avoid the law by falling back on State protection, and
issuing passes within the limits of each State. Three of
the large railroad systems, when called on by the Commission
to make an exhibit of the passes issued by them,
declined to do so on the ground that the passes were limited
to the bounds of the State, and therefore not within
the jurisdiction of the Commission. If the New York
Central and Pennsylvania railroads can thus issue passes
at discretion it is impracticable to enforce the laws against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>their competitors.”<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a> By issuing to a favored individual
a pass good in Pennsylvania, another good in Ohio, another
for Indiana, another for Illinois, etc., the Pennsylvania
Railroad can give the beneficiary as full freedom of its
lines as any interstate pass could give.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pass making went merrily on all over the country, with
a complaint now and then to let in the light, but no effective
crusade against the disease. The Boston and Maine,
for example, issued passes in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
and Massachusetts, to public officers of the States
and the United States, members of legislatures, and railroad
commissions, agents of ice companies, milk contractors,
newspaper men, etc.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a> The Commission recorded its
protest and declared that the “similar circumstances” of
the Interstate Act do not relate to the social or official
position of the passenger;<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a> but the pestilence is beyond the
reach of the national board, and after eighteen years of
Federal prohibition our railroad business is still honeycombed
with political and commercial passes, as we have
already seen in the second chapter of this book.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ticket scalping, “an obvious evasion of the law,” and
the payment of commissions on the sale of tickets in addition
to salaries, so that the brokers were tempted to cut
rates dividing their commissions with their customers,
continued in full bloom in spite of the Federal law. The
commissions were $1 from New England points to Chicago;
$1 from Chicago to the Missouri River; and $1
from the river to Denver. In addition to such definite
amounts some roads paid 10 percent on their receipts for
the passage, making a total commission of $4 or $5 or more
in some cases for the sale of a single ticket.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a> “In cases of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>commissions of only $1 for short distances there may be
little or no inducement for the agent to divide with the
passenger, but in cases of cumulative commissions for long
distances the temptation to divide is stronger, and the
probability of abuse is so great that the impropriety of
putting the opportunity before the agent is manifest. It
is not unusual for a single company to pay a sum of
$100,000 or even more in a year, and the aggregate entailed
reaches millions of dollars. This money is illegitimately
spent; it is paid in excess of salaries to agents for
the purpose of taking business from competitors, and when
competitors all do it, it is difficult to see how any benefit
can accrue from it to any company.”<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In 1890 the Commission reported that scalpers were
supported by the railroads. They found 15 scalping
offices in Chicago, 9 in Cincinnati, 13 in New York, 7 in
Kansas City, etc. In 1895 they found that scalping “was
steadily enlarging in scope and volume.”<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a> In 1897 the
“vicious practice” was still in full swing, though New
York, New Jersey, and eight other States had passed stringent
laws against it.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> But it has now been largely reduced,
though by no means abolished, and the diminution has
come, not because the law acquired sufficient vigor to get
itself enforced, but because the railroad presidents combined
to stop the practice, which was recognized to be injurious
to railroad interests.<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In respect to other forms of discrimination between passengers
the Commission ordered that rates for groups or
parties must not be lower than the regular fare for one
passenger multiplied by the number of persons in the
party,<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a> and that although separate cars might be provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>for colored persons, they must have equal accommodations
with white people who pay the same fare.<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Turning to freight discriminations, we find that a bewildering
mass of questions and complaints has pressed
upon the Commission. It has shown an earnest desire for
justice, and for the most part good judgment, but it has
accomplished comparatively little in the way of stopping
unjust discriminations. Witnesses refused to testify, on
the ground that testimony in respect to rebates and other
forms of discrimination might be used to convict them of
crime.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Counselman case (142 U. S. 547), Jan., 1892, the
U. S. Supreme Court decided that a witness could not be
compelled to testify in regard to discrimination in which
he was involved, since the Federal law made it a criminal
offence to make or benefit by discrimination. Unless the
law exempts the witness from prosecution in consequence
of his answers or in relation to the subject of them, he is
not obliged to answer a question when the answer might
tend to incriminate him.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Refusal to answer on such a plea
is of course equivalent to confession of guilt. In this case
Counselman, a large grain shipper, had been given rates on
corn some 5 cents less per hundred than the rates paid by
others from Kansas and Nebraska points to Chicago, over
the Rock Island, Burlington, and other railroads. Five
cents a hundred is an enormous profit on corn which the
farmer had sold at 18 to 22 cents per hundred, and such a
margin would enable the favored shipper to drive every one
else out of the trade; and on many western roads it has been
practically the case that only the railway officials and their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>secret partners can do business. Counselman refused to
tell a United States grand jury whether or no he had had
any rebates from the railroads in 1890. He said he had
received none from Stickney’s road, nor from the Santa Fe,
had had no business with the latter, he thought, but as to
the Rock Island, C. B. &amp; Q., etc., he declined to answer on
the plea that to do so might incriminate him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some railroad officials testified freely, but neglected to
tell the truth.<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a> Discriminations as a rule were secret.
Even when it was clearly known that favoritism was being
shown, shippers were generally afraid to complain, and in
the small percent of cases where complaint and investigation
took place it seemed impossible to get at the truth in
any large way, because the railroad men for the most part
would not “cough up” the facts. Still, something was
done by the Interstate Commission, the courts, and the
Industrial Commission. Some progress was made and some
light secured. The jets of flame that here and there came
up through the cracks from the under-world showed very
clearly what was going on beneath the surface of railway
affairs.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><em>Direct Rebates.</em></h3>

<p class='c014'>Direct rebates on interstate traffic appear to have been
checked for a few months after the passage of the Commerce
Act, but the railroads admitted that they still gave
rebates on traffic within a State<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a> just as they continued to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>give passes, making them good within one State, insisting
in respect to both rebates and passes that they had a right
to give them because the law did not reach State traffic.
Nevertheless, as the Commission remarked, such rebates
inevitably affect the rates upon interstate traffic, and a competing
road whose traffic is taken a little further, crossing
the state line, may be compelled to give rebates or surrender
important business.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact, discriminating rates and rebates on
interstate as well as State business were soon as much in
fashion as ever.<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In one small town in the Middle West judgments for
nearly $40,000 were recovered against a railroad for illegal
discriminations in that one town. In some cases the discriminations
amount to $40 a car. These cases were all
subsequent to the Interstate Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some years ago the Chief Justice of Kansas declared that
the Santa Fe management preceding the present one was
notorious for giving secret rebates. The president of the
road was asked to resign because the railroad funds were
some millions short, due, it is said, to the secret rebates
the company had paid. An expert went over the books
and discovered that some $7,000,000 had been paid in
rebates by the Santa Fe in a few years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shippers who would not or could not get rebates or concessions
were in danger of serious loss and perhaps ruin.
Mr. H. F. Douseman, for many years a grain shipper in
Chicago, and chairman of the board of trade of that city,
had to go out of business because he would not take the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>rebates he might have had. Before 1887 he took rebates
of 10 or 15 percent (2 or 3 cents on the cwt.), but after that
he refused them. “Virtue is its own reward,” and Mr.
Houseman got his pay in that form. “I feel that I have
been driven out of business because I would not accept a
rebate,” he told the Industrial Commission. “I have never
taken a rebate since the Interstate Law went into effect.
I did not propose to put myself in the shape of a criminal.”<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It may be a matter of surprise to many that even one
man of this kind could be found in Chicago. If such virtue
were prevalent the enforcement of law would be easy.
Mr. Douseman says that for 6 months after the Interstate
Law was passed no rebates were paid; everybody was on
an equality. “After the first six months, rebates began
to be given. At the end of the first year they were quite
frequent, and they have continued ever since. Prior to
1887 the only time when rates were absolutely solid, when
every one was on the same basis, was when the Vanderbilts
were trying to bankrupt the West Shore road, and rates
were down to 12 cents in New York. Everybody then,
as I understand, had the same rates.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The condition of things in 1890 is shown by the reported
statement of a Chicago railroad manager quoted by the
Commission. “The situation in the West is so bad that it
could hardly be worse. Rates are absolutely demoralized,
and neither shippers, passengers, railways, nor the public in
general make anything by this state of affairs. Take passenger
rates for instance; they are very low; but who
benefits by the reduction? No one but the scalpers....
In freight matters the case is just the same. Certain
shippers are allowed heavy rebates, while others are made
to pay full rates.... The management is dishonest on all
sides, and there is not a road in the country that can be
accused of living up to the Interstate Law. Of course
when some poor devil comes along and wants a pass to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>save him from starvation, he has several clauses of the
Interstate Act read to him; but when a rich shipper wants
a pass, why, he gets it at once.”<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Complaints and investigations from time to time in subsequent
years showed the continuance of these conditions.
For one concern a large number of cars of corn were carried
from Kansas City to St. Louis at 6 cents per hundred lbs.
while the tariff was 15 cents.<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a> In the traffic to Chicago
one firm shipped all the grain over one road, and another
firm “had the rate” on another line. It was clear that
these shippers had advantages that enabled them to keep
other shippers out of the field.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A wholesale grocery house getting 25 percent rebate
on its shipments established branches in various cities.
Through a disagreement with one of the railroads that
thought it was not getting its share of the business, the
rebate enjoyed by one of the branches was withdrawn,
and the branch in that city went out of business. A
leading dry-goods firm declared that so long as it secured
a rebate of 25 percent it had no objection to existing
methods of rate-making.<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The International Coal Company declared, in a suit
against the Pennsylvania Railroad for damages, that it
was driven out of business by discrimination, its rival
receiving rebates of 20 cents per ton in 1898–9 and 10
cents per ton in 1899–1900.</p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads show a disposition to back each other in
disregarding the law. Mr. McCabe, traffic manager for
the Pennsylvania lines west of Pittsburg, said the Pennsylvania
system would stand by any rate made by its
connecting lines.<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>SUBSTITUTES FOR REBATES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Numerous substitutes for the direct rebate were used. In
some cases $10 a car was paid on shipments of flour from
the Northwest under pretence of paying for the cost of
loading the car above the minimum weight.<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a> Railroads
paid 50 cents for the loading of each private stock car, and
¾ of a cent for every mile the car was hauled, loaded or
empty. Yardage was also paid to the car-line for keeping
the cattle in its charge in its own yards, at the rate of
3½ cents per hundred lbs. for all cattle hauled to its yards.
“The amount of these rebates,” said the Commission, “more
than pays the entire cost of the improved stock cars within
2 years, besides covering operating expenses.”<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Twenty-six railroad companies operating in the territory
extending in different directions from Chicago, and engaged
in the business in which discriminations by allowances of
car-mileage were supposed to exist, were summoned to make
a showing of the allowances paid by each of them for car-mileage
for the different classes of cars furnished by shippers,
car companies, and individuals, or connecting lines.
A single railroad company paid car-mileage to 65 different
companies or firms owning cars, of which number 54 were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>shippers and the rest fast freights. The Commission found
that the mileage paid on private cars yielded a profit in
many cases of 25 percent, 50 percent, and even more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The rates allowed for car-mileage were shown to be as
follows: For ordinary freight cars, a uniform rate of ¾ of a
cent a mile; for Pullman palace cars, 3 cents a mile; for
Pullman tourist sleepers, 1 cent a mile; for ordinary passenger
cars exchanged with other companies, 3 cents a mile;
for baggage, mail, and express cars exchanged with other
companies, 1½ cents a mile by some roads, and 3 cents a mile
by others; for refrigerator cars used for carrying dressed
beef, 1 cent a mile in some cases, and in other cases ¾ of a
cent a mile; for furniture cars, oil-tank cars, palace live-stock
cars, and other cars owned by private individuals and
companies, ¾ of a cent a mile. Some companies pay mileage
on tank cars both loaded and empty, and some only
when loaded. For palace horse-cars no mileage is allowed
on some roads, shippers in such cars paying for the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The cost of the investment in cars, and the amount of
mileage allowed for their use, show that the investment is
very profitable. Refrigerator cars cost from $900 to $1000;
private cattle-cars cost about $650; oil-tank cars about
$610; cars used for the transportation of live hogs about
$500; ordinary freight cars from $450 to $500. Repairs
on the cars are made by the railroad company in whose use
they are when repairs are required. The life of a box car
averages 15 years, and of a refrigerator car 8 years.”<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c012'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“Private cars,” owned by the railroads but chartered for
private use, were the subject of discrimination of another
kind. For example, a commercial salesman travelled with
his assistant over the Northern Pacific in a private car
stocked with samples. For the first trip he paid 15 round-trip
fares between St. Paul and Portland, but for subsequent
trips the road charged 15 local fares from point to
point where stoppages were made. As theatrical and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>parties in private cars were usually carried for 15 round-trip fares it was alleged to be unfair to charge the drummer
local rates.<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Terminal charges for delivery at certain places were
made a means of discrimination.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a> Free cartage for some
shippers and not for others,<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a> or for one town and not for
another, gave a decided advantage to the favored shippers.</p>

<p class='c007'>To get the business of B., a Pittsburg dealer in beer, the
B. &amp; O., with the approval of Wight, one of its general officers,
gave B. 3½ cents per hundred for hauling his own
beer from the station, while K., another beer dealer there,
received no such concession, but paid the same freight rates
and hauled his beer at his own expense. Wight was indicted
and convicted before the district court for violation
of Section 2 of the Interstate Act, and the United States
Supreme Court sustained the decision in 167 U. S. 512,
May, 1897, holding that the cartage allowance in one case
and not in the other was a discrimination under the 2d
section of the Commerce Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Grand Rapids, Michigan, free cartage had been in
vogue for 25 years, but in Ionia, near by, no free cartage
was afforded by the railroads, although the station was
nearer the centre or main delivery area of the city than in
Grand Rapids. This had the effect of a discrimination
against the merchants of Ionia amounting to about 2 cents
per hundred lbs.<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>In June, 1889, the Commission asked most of the leading
roads, 585 in number, for information about free cartage
delivery. From the answers it appears “that 65 railroads
allowed free cartage delivery or equalizing cartage allowances,
and 389 railroads do neither; 200 companies only
switch cars over to mills and manufacturers. No company
furnishes free cartage delivery at all stations, but as a rule,
only at a few stations. The estimated cost of free cartage
delivery will average about 2½ cents per hundred pounds.
Where an allowance is made for switching or for equalizing
distances from shippers, the average cost is about $2 per
car or $2.50.”<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Denial of the stoppage-in-transit privilege at one locality
while allowing it to others is unlawful.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a> Differences in the
time allowed for unloading may amount to a substantial
preference. At Philadelphia 96 hours was allowed for unloading,
against 72 hours at interior points, for coal, coke,
or iron, and 48 hours for other goods. With demurrage
charges of $1 for each day’s delay in unloading beyond the
allotted time, the difference between 48 and 96 hours would
mean $2 a car.<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Free storage is another method of favoritism, sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>used systematically and extensively, as described by the
Commission. “A shipper sends a carload of freight to a
specific destination consigned to his order by arrangement
with the carrier. The freight is kept in the car or freight
house or some warehouse which the carrier controls, and on
orders of the shipper or his agent issued from time to time
the freight is delivered in small lots to designated persons.
These persons are the actual consignees, and the shipper is
enabled by this means to avoid paying the higher less-than-carload
rate and to reap other advantages through this privilege
of storage. Such special facilities as storage, handling,
cartage, distribution, and reshipment of less quantities, either
without charge or at extremely low compensation for the
character of the service, amounted substantially to providing
a shipper with branch business houses.”<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Overbilling and underbilling have been found to be very
convenient substitutes for the rebate. A bill of lading may
acknowledge the receipt of 70 barrels of flour; 65 only are
shipped, and the railway pays damages for the loss of the
5 non-existent barrels. On the other hand railroads have
been known to suggest to millers that they ship flour on
the generous plan of shipping 200 barrels and billing 125.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
Some shippers have been allowed to ship only 4 boxes of
peaches to the hundred lbs., while others were permitted to
ship 6 boxes to the hundred lbs. “That is the billing.
Sometimes peaches are billed 4 boxes to the hundred lbs. to
one point, and 6 boxes to the hundred lbs. to a point 350
miles farther on.”<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a> At another time the cashier of an
important firm is made a nominal agent for the railway
company, and under the name of commission to him an
enormous rebate is allowed for all the business his employers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>send over the line. Or again, the railway company
purchases from a favored trader its supplies of the goods in
which he deals, at a fancy price.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “expense bill system” has proved to be an instrument
of preference and fraud. On presentation of an
“expense bill” showing payment for shipments into Kansas
City the railroads would allow reshipment of an equal
weight from Kansas City to Chicago at the balance of the
through rate from the point of origin to Chicago.<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a> This
gave grain from the West an advantage over grain grown
near Kansas City. When the rate from Kansas City to
Chicago was 20 cents on wheat and 17 cents on corn the
grain carried on the balance of the through rate under the
expense bill system was carried 8 to 10 cents less than grain
grown in Missouri and Iowa.<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Not satisfied with the discounts obtained on actual expense
bills, shippers altered bills and forged new ones to
enlarge their traffic at the cut rates. In this way “expense
bills showing a high balance were constantly substituted
for those showing a low balance.”<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Rebate equivalents were given in the form of elevator
rebates and allowances. Elevators owned or controlled by
railroad companies were leased at nominal charges to favored
shippers, or secret commissions were paid to favored parties
for all grain consigned to specified elevators. One railroad
for example paid a concern, holding a line of elevators on
the railroad, 1¼ cents per 100 on all grain consigned to
those elevators.<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>In this case the consignment was 150 cars a day from
November to May, averaging 32,000 to 34,000 lbs. a car.
The commissions therefore amounted to $4 a car, $600 a
day, $120,000 a year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The United States Industrial Commission says, under the
head of “Freight discriminations and allowances to elevators:”
“On each of the leading railways from grain-producing
sections to Chicago, allowances, ranging from
one-half to 1½ cents per bushel, are made on grain to
one or two favored firms.... The favored elevators are
thus enabled to pay higher prices for grain. The average
profit in handling grain is less than 1½ cents per bushel,
and smaller buyers can thus easily be driven out of business....
The small shipper being driven out of business,
the large dealer is then in a position to depress the price of
grain to the producer.”<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads deny equal rights in the building of elevators.
A railroad which had granted the right for two elevators
at Elmwood on the company’s right of way refused
to give H. &amp; Co. the same privilege. The State Board of
Transportation ordered the railroad to discontinue the discrimination
against H. &amp; Co., and give them the same privileges
as others. But the United States Supreme Court
held that the road could not be forced to grant its property
for private use.<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>One method of discrimination I learned of in the West a
few years ago is not adequately described in any report.<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The head of a road running into Chicago from Missouri
River points formed a grain company to buy grain in
Kansas City and sell it in Chicago. The railway guaranteed
the grain company against loss. When wheat was 50
cents in Kansas City and 60 cents in Chicago, the grain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>company paid 51 cents in Kansas City to get the grain.
The railroad charged the regular 10 cent tariff. The
grain was sold at 60. The railroad paid back 1 cent on
the guarantee and still made 9 cents. And the railroad-grain-company-combine
was able to drive other buyers out
of the market and other railroads out of the traffic. The
Santa Fe, for example, carried 28 percent of the grain
going into Kansas City, but only hauled 3 percent out to
Chicago.</p>

<p class='c007'>Railroads sometimes seek to evade the law by contracting
to deliver goods at a certain price including the freight
and the payment for the goods in one lump sum, so that
the freight charge is merged and cannot be ascertained.
Nine years ago, in 1896, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad
contracted with the New York, New Haven and Hartford
to deliver 2,000,000 tons of coal at New Haven at $2.75 a
ton. The published freight rate at that time was $1.15
and the price of the coal at the mines $2 a ton. The Interstate
Commerce Commission held that this was a discrimination
by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad against
every independent mine owner in its territory, and that the
railroad had no right to contract to sell coal at any price.
The Federal Court sustained this view, and it is stated that
the Department of Justice will ask the Supreme Court for
a blanket injunction against the two railroads, restraining
them from carrying freight at less than the published rates.
It is said that J. Pierpont Morgan guaranteed that the
Chesapeake and Ohio would perform the contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>Action <em>against</em> an individual or company is quite as
effective a form of discrimination as action in favor of a
rival. Shippers at a certain place on the Chicago and
Northwestern were handicapped by refusal of through
rates on asbestos, compelling them to pay higher rates than
their competitors.<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a> A Southern railroad charged the Bigby
Packet Company a much higher rate on cotton from Mobile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>to New Orleans than the established rate on local shipments
of cotton, in order to discourage shipments by way
of the Packet Company from the point of origin in Alabama,
and compel the cotton to travel all the way by
rail.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>DENIAL OF FAIR FACILITIES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The refusal to furnish cars in fair proportion is a familiar
form of discrimination all through this period, usually in
combination with other forms of preference. In Kansas,
on the line of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway,
were two coal companies whose plants were of about equal
capacity, and several individual shippers. The railway and
its officials became interested in one of the coal companies,
and by rebate and other process it was given rates which
averaged only forty percent of the rates charged other
shippers. The result was that all the other shippers were
driven out of business, part of them being hopelessly ruined
before giving up the struggle. In addition to rate discrimination
the railway practised gross favoritism in the distribution
of cars. For example, during one period of 564
days, as was proven in court, the road delivered to the
Pittsburg Coal Company 2,371 empty cars to be loaded
with coal, although such company had sale for, and capacity
to produce and load, during the same period, more than
15,000 cars. During the same time this railway company
delivered to the Rogers Coal Company, in which the railway
company and C. W. Rogers, its vice-president and
general manager, were interested, no less than 15,483 coal
cars, while 466 were delivered to individual shippers. In
other words, the coal company owned in large part by the
railway and its officials, was given 82 percent of all the
facilities to get coal to market, although the other shippers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>had much greater combined capacity than the Rogers Coal
Company.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the last four months of the period named, and
when the Pittsburg Coal Company had the plant, force,
and capacity to load thirty cars per day, they received an
average of one and one-fourth cars per day, resulting as
was intended, in the utter ruin of a prosperous business
and the involuntary sale of the property, while the railway
coal company, the railway officials, and the accommodating
friends who operated the Rogers Coal Company, made vast
sums of money; and when all other shippers had thus been
driven off the line the price of coal was advanced to the
consumer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another railway interested in a coal mine furnished cars
in abundance to that mine and to others that would sell
their product to the mining company in which the railway
was interested, but systematically failed to furnish cars to
other operators.<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a> One operator, after being forced for years
in this way to sell his product to the railway mining company
at a very low price, was obliged to build a railway of
his own in order to reach other lines of railroad and so
have a fighting chance for cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Arkansas a coal mine owned by the Gould interests
was able to ship its product to market at very low rates,
while the owners of an adjoining mine were forced to haul
their coal to the same market in wagons because the rates
charged them from the coal railway were so high as to
absorb the whole value of the coal at destination.</p>

<p class='c007'>A big capitalist in the West got hold of great oil fields
on the Pacific slope, wonderful prospects, contracts to
supply big cities, etc. Some one told him he had better
see the railroads before he made his contracts. He thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the transportation question would be all right and went
ahead. When he got his contracts made and wanted to
ship the oil, he asked for cars, and then he found the transportation
question was not all right. He could not get
the cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes a railroad has arbitrarily refused to haul
goods to certain consignees. A case of this kind came
before the Texas Railway Commission in the case of the
Independent Compress <em>v.</em> Chicago, Rock Island and Texas
Railway Company. The Bowie Compress, located at the
same station with the Independent, had some sort of pull
which caused the railroad to refuse to haul cotton to that
station unless consigned to the Bowie Compress. The
railway also allowed compression charges out of the through
rate on cotton shipped to the Bowie Compress, refused
freight from points of origin, and reshipped the cotton
from the Bowie press at through rates, while refusing such
concessions to others.<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The refusal to deliver at a certain place may be as effective
sometimes as the refusal to deliver at all. When in
1890 Mr. Nelson Morris tried to establish competitive stock
yards in Chicago to get rid of the graft of the Union Stock
Yards owned largely by railway interests, the Vanderbilts
being in the lead, his enterprise was loudly applauded by
the stock raisers of the West; but the railroads made short
work of Morris. They simply refused to deliver to his
yards the cars shipped there. They did not recognize any
such place as the Morris yards and calmly hauled all cars
to the old terminal. If Mr. Morris wanted them he must
come and get them and pay switching charges. This
ruined the venture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Big shippers may be given an undue advantage by
excessive difference between the rates on carloads and less than carloads.<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a>
On June 29, 1898, the Western railroads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>advanced their less-than-carload rates to the Pacific Coast
to a minimum difference of 50 cents a cwt. above the
carload rate; and “on a great many commodities the difference
is greater than the profit on the goods.”<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a> The
Interstate Commission regards a moderate reduction on
carload shipments as fair, but will not sanction lower rates
for cargo or train-load quantities than for carloads.<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>CLASSIFICATION AND COMMODITY RATES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Classification and commodity rates afford many examples
of discrimination in the period we are studying.
We find furs and fur scraps classed as double first-class,
while hats and fancy products, for which these commodities
constitute raw material, were first-class.<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c012'><sup>[89]</sup></a> Celery was classed
with peaches and grapes, instead of with cauliflower and
asparagus, lettuce and peas.<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c012'><sup>[90]</sup></a> The charge for beans and
peas (70 cents) was almost double the charge on tomatoes
(44 cents).<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c012'><sup>[91]</sup></a> Flour for export was carried at much lower
rates than wheat. Before 1886 wheat was carried from
Texas, Missouri, and Kansas at 15 cents per hundred lbs.
less than flour, without regard to distance. From 1886
to the end of this middle period the rates on wheat for
export show a difference of 4 to 11 cents per hundred below
the rates on flour. As the profit to American millers
on flour for export is from 1 to 3 cents per hundred it is
clear that such discrimination is prohibitive upon American
millers in favor of English and other foreign millers. The
public policy and good railway policy seem to require the
same rate on export wheat and export flour.<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c012'><sup>[92]</sup></a> Corn was
carried between Kansas points and Texas points for 7 cents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>per hundred less than corn meal,—a strong discrimination
against Kansas millers.<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a> The Eastern railways also carried
corn at lower rates than corn meal to Eastern mills, and
carried the meal, hominy, ground corn, etc., back to Indiana.
This gave the railways more traffic, but it was a tremendous
waste of industrial force and injured the Western mills, since
a discrimination of 5 percent was sufficient to eat up three
or four times the profit of any miller.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Southern Railway put soap in the sixth class with a
rate of 49 cents a hundred, or 33 cents when shipped by
large manufacturers, while Pearline was put in the fourth
class with a rate of 73 cents a hundred. Pearline and soap
are competitors. There is no appreciable difference in the
cost of transportation. But Pearline commands a higher
price, so the railways charged more than double the rate
they got for soap from the manufacturers. In another case
brought before the Commission in 1889, soap in carload lots
was put in class V, while sugar, cerealine, cracked wheat,
starch, rice, coffee, pickles, etc., were in class VI. One
make of soap was put by many railroads in the second class,
while other soaps of similar use and value were in the
fourth class.<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>One of the strangest anomalies of classification is the
rating of patent medicines as first-class, while ale and beer
are third class. In a complaint on the latter score by a
prominent manufacturer of patent medicines against the
New York Central and other railroads, it was shown that
the medicines were similar in bulk and intrinsic value to
the liquors, and it is possible that the similarity went much
farther than this.</p>

<p class='c007'>Blocks intended for wagon-hubs took one rate on the
Lake Shore and Michigan Southern and boards for wagon
boxes another rate.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Railroad ties have been charged a higher rate than
lumber. A high rate on railroad ties prevents their being
shipped and depreciates their value at home, so that the
discriminating company is able to buy them at a low price.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Union Pacific years ago made prohibitory rates on
steel rails in order to hinder or prevent the construction of
a road that promised to become a competitor of one of the
Union Pacific’s connecting lines. Prohibitory rates on
rails, ties, etc., have often been maintained to obstruct the
building of competing lines, and to render them more
costly.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>OIL AND BEEF.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Oil in Standard hands continued to receive favorable
attention from the railroads throughout the middle period.
The Combine was preferred by an “unreasonable mileage”
payment of ¾ of a cent a mile on its tank cars, loaded or
empty,<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a> while others who attempted to ship in tank cars
had to pay mileage to the railroads for the return of their
empties; by practically compelling independents to ship in
barrels, and charging for the weight of the barrel; and by
making an arbitrary allowance of 42 gallons for leakage on
tank shipments with no allowance for waste in barrel
shipments.<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Commission held it unjust to allow for leakage on
tank shipments and not on barrel shipments; that the
weight of the barrel must not be charged for if the weight
of the tank is not, the same quantity of oil must have the
same rate no matter what the package might be, unless the
shippers were offered facilities for shipment by tank as well
as barrels so that the option was theirs. The representative
of the oil combination was questioned by the Interstate
Commerce Commissioners, in relation to the mileage, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Are you allowed mileage on tank cars?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Neither way?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Neither way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the railroad officials in this case refused to commit
oil-perjury. Asked what mileage they paid the Combine
they replied: “Three-quarters of a cent a mile.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Rice asked what the railroads would charge him
for bringing back his empty cars if he shipped in tanks, he
was told he would have to pay 1½ cents or more a mile.
He found that if he tried to sell his oil in California it
would cost him $95 to get the empty tank car back, while
the railroads paid the Standard for the privilege of hauling
its empties back. Rice saw that from the South he could
get return loads of turpentine, but the railroads absolutely
refused to give him rates.<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Besides all this the Standard was accorded the privilege
of systematic underbilling. According to the testimony
before the Commission in 1898 by the Boston &amp; Albany
agent in East Boston, the centre of the Standard Oil
business in New England, the Combine’s tank cars,
which usually weigh from 35,000 to 50,000 lbs., were
ordinarily billed at 24,000 lbs. Out of 14 cars sent
over another road from East Boston to Newport, R. I.,
at least half were billed and paid for on the basis of
24,000 lbs. to the car, although their average weight was
shown to be 48,550 lbs. per car. It was claimed that
these underbillings were clerical errors. In considering
the motives and reliability of such a claim we must not
forget the curious habit shown by these clerical errors
of piling up in great bunches in the Standard Oil business,
and the still more curious fact that all the errors
are in favor of the Trust—none against it. Long before
the Commission had found that the railroads leading
from the oil fields were in the habit of “blind billing”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the Standard cars at 20,000 lbs., though the actual
weight was frequently 30,000, 40,000, 44,000 or more.<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a>
Rice complained of this to the Commission in July,
1887. Immediately all the old numbers on the 3000
tank cars of the Oil Trust were painted out and new
numbers painted on, so that the cars mentioned in the
railroad accounts could no longer be identified with the
cars on the tracks.<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a> The Standard has some very oily
ways, and knows how to use a pot of paint and a brush
as well as a rebate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Standard desired to fix the rates on oil to New
England, the South, and the West, and as usual the railroads
let it have its way. The result was a practice of
adding the Boston rate to the local rate on shipments of
oil into New England, which puts the independent refiners
at a great disadvantage. The rate on corn from Cleveland
to Boston is 15 cents per hundred lbs., and to New Haven
the same, but the rate on petroleum from Cleveland to
Boston is 24 cents, and to New Haven it is the Boston
rate, 24 cents, plus the local rate, or a total of 36 cents
from Cleveland to New Haven. Now the Standard Oil
has got large warehouses in East Boston, and they bring
their oil by boat and store it there, and then they get the
freight rates simply from Boston down to the Connecticut
point, whereas the Western refiner who has no storehouse
has to pay first the Boston rate, and then this local rate
also to the other point, even though the oil may go direct,
so that the rates are practically prohibitive to the Western
refiners.<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c012'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To shut out the oil fields and independent refineries of
Colorado and Wyoming, the Standard resorted to terrific
discrimination in rates. The Chicago and Northwestern
Road would bring a carload of cattle from Wyoming to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Chicago for $105, but for a car of 75 barrels of oil the
freight was lifted to $348. The rates from the Western
fields to San Francisco were also put very high, and the
Standard built great storehouses on the Pacific Coast, which
it fills from the Eastern fields, the freight rates from the
East being suddenly lowered when it wishes to refill the
said storehouses, and put back again as soon as they are
full. The people of California are compelled to buy Eastern
oil for the profit of the Trust, instead of buying Colorado
oil, because the freight on the latter is prohibitive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aside from these sudden fainting spells of the oil tariff
at convenient seasons for the Standard, the ordinary arrangements
showed thoughtful care for its comfort. The
regular rate on oil from the Colorado oil wells to the Pacific
Coast was made 96 cents per hundred, while the rate from
Chicago through Colorado is only 78½ cents per hundred.<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c012'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Chicago pork-packers generally had things their
own way in this period, but apparently not always. In
1890 the Commission decided that the railroads were discriminating
against the Chicago packers by lower rates
from the Missouri River on hog products than on live
hogs.<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c012'><sup>[102]</sup></a> Even then, however, they were receiving rebates
from the railroads which made questions of tariff rates
comparatively insignificant.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1891 the Federal Grand Jury indicted Swift &amp; Co.,
the Chicago packers, for having received $5,000 a month
in rebates from one road alone, the Nickel Plate. Compared
to the train loads of their cars passing east and west
on other lines, their traffic on the Nickel Plate was light.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his testimony to the Senate Committee this spring,
Mr. Davis said: “A few years ago one of the Chicago
packers was a director on a Western railroad. He was a
large receiver of live-stock from Kansas City, upon which
the freight rate was $54 per car. A rebate of $25 was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>paid to the packer at the time of shipment, and it was the
custom to file claims for the remaining $29, which were
allowed on the grounds of some imaginary loss or damage
to the stock in transit. The same party paid rebates
amounting to from $30,000 to $50,000 a month for every
month in the year. On putting down on a piece of paper
the amount of $10,000, and after placing this under the
eyes of a superior officer, he would leave and subsequently
look for that amount in currency by express,
and would then proceed to divide it among certain favored
shippers.”<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c012'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A few years ago, in proceedings before Judge Grosscup
of Chicago, it appeared that while the published rate on
packing-house products was 23½ cents, the favored packers
were given a rate as low as 15 cents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Investigations by the Commission in December, 1901, and
January, 1902, took the lid off of the dressed-meat business
and discovered a large congregation of secret rebates. The
Pennsylvania system was cutting the rate on packing-house
products 5 to 7 cents below the published rate, making it
25 cents and sometimes 22 cents, in place of 30 cents, from
Chicago to New York. Rates from Indianapolis, Cincinnati,
and other points were also cut.<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c012'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The examination brought out the fact that President
Cassatt and other officers above the traffic manager knew
what he was doing and authorized or permitted the rate
cutting.<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c012'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner Clements.</span> Who takes the responsibility
for doing these things, for making these serious
departures and cuts, in regard to the Pennsylvania Railroad?

being governed by the competitive conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner Clements.</span> Do you have reason to
know that the officers above you in the management of
that company’s affairs knew of it?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. McCabe.</span> Not in detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner Clements.</span> I do not mean the details.
I could have answered that myself. But as to the general
fact that the Pennsylvania Railroad was cutting the rate
in this serious way, was it known to the president of that
company and other officers?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. McCabe.</span> I do not know.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner Clements.</span> Have you ever had any
conference with the officers above you in the management
of that company’s affairs in which you disclosed this condition
of things?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. McCabe.</span> I have said to them from time to time
that rate conditions were so and so; that rates were not
being maintained, and that our competitors were cutting
the rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner Clements.</span> And that you must cut
the rates? Did they sanction it, or approve it, or tell you
to stop it?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. McCabe.</span> I think they left it to my discretion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Big Four, a Vanderbilt line, cut rates 6 cents below
the 30 cent tariff from St. Louis.<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c012'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Mitchell, traffic manager of the Michigan Central,
says his road carried dressed meats at 40 cents, or 5 cents
below the published rate.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“<span class='sc'>Chairman of the Commission.</span> Did you carry any
considerable amount of dressed meats during 1901 that
paid the tariff rate?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mitchell.</span> I think not.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Chairman.</span> Practically all of it went at some secret
rate?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mitchell.</span> Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This man thought his road paid the four Beef Trust
houses $200,000 or $240,000 a year in rebates.<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c012'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Mitchell said rebates were paid indirectly by means
of bank drafts. The railroad makes a deposit in bank.
The traffic manager checks against it, and the bank supplies
drafts on New York or cashier’s checks which are sent to
the persons who are to receive rebates.<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c012'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads try to be good sometimes, make New Year’s
resolutions, and stop the rebates; but some naughty boy
breaks his vows in two or three weeks, and then the rest
follow suit. Here is the testimony of a Western traffic
manager on this point.<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c012'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner.</span> What proportion of the traffic (in provisions)
have you carried at the tariff rate?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Traffic Manager.</span> It was a very small proportion
of the total, and it was probably along about the first of
last year.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner.</span> You are accustomed to indulge in
New Year’s resolutions?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Manager.</span> Yes, sir; we all swear off on New Year’s,
and begin again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner.</span> Is it a fact that from Jan. 1, 1901,
there was a period when the tariff rate (on provisions)
was actually applied by all the roads?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Manager.</span> Yes, sir; I think it was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner.</span> How long did it last?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“<span class='sc'>Manager.</span> I think it lasted probably two weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner.</span> What led you, then, to cut your rate
through St. Louis?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Manager.</span> Our agent in Kansas City discovered about
January 20 that provisions were moving through Chicago
at less than tariff rate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Commission found that all the railroads made low
rates for the Beef Trust, but they could not find any railroad
that led off in the business of cutting rates. Each
one said it cut rates because it found the others were
cutting. They were all followers.<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c012'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Chairman of the Commission said to the Vanderbilt
traffic man: “I observed that you spoke of your road as
following the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Cost.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>The Chairman.</span> I have heard a similar statement
from other gentlemen. Have you any idea who is the

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Cost.</span> No; I have not. I could not give you
that information.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Cost.</span> No, sir.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>The Chairman.</span> They are all followers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Cost.</span> That does really seem to be the case.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Grammer, general traffic manager of the Lake Shore,
testified in 1902 in respect to “provisions,” cut meats, lard,
etc., from Chicago to New York: “The minimum weight
on a car of provisions is 28,000 lbs. The rate is 25 cents.
That is about the maximum rate obtained this last year,
1901, and that means $70 a car. We pay out of that to
the stockyards $2.40 a car for switching, we pay $15 car-mileage
for a round trip of the car, and at New York we pay
3 cents a hundred lighterage; that is, $2.40 and $15, $17.40,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>and $8.40—$25.80 which we pay out of that rate as absolute
arbitraries. That leaves the Lake Shore $16 or $17 net for
hauling that car to Buffalo, with the return car empty, and
we have to give practically passenger service to that traffic.
I think it is unremunerative business, and I have always
taken the position that we do not want any provisions on
the Lake Shore road at less than the full tariff rate, whatever
that might be. The dressed-beef minimum will average
22,000 lbs. That car is subject to the same arbitraries
and mileage. The lighterage is 3 cents a hundred, which
would be $6.60 instead of $8.40, and it is subject to the
same service eastbound and westbound as to movement;
and there is not 1 percent of those cars loaded east with
dressed beef that are loaded with any freight coming west.”
In spite of the unremunerative character of the business
Manager Grammer says they cut the rate 5 cents a
hundred.<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c012'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Paul Morton, at the head of the traffic department
of the Santa Fe, testified in 1902<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c012'><sup>[112]</sup></a> that his road carried
dressed meats and packing-house products below the published
rates in violation of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Morton.</span> We have carried the business from
Kansas City to Chicago for 5 cents less than the published
tariff to Chicago and Chicago junction points.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Day.</span> Domestic as well as export?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Morton.</span> Both.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Santa Fe,” he said, “at the beginning of 1901
joined with the other roads in a general declaration of good
faith and intention of an absolute maintenance of rates.
We maintained the rate until about April 1.” The Santa
Fe found that they were only carrying 2 percent of the
packing-house business out of Kansas City, although they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>brought in 33⅓ percent of all the live-stock that entered
the city. So “we told one of the largest shippers in Kansas
City that if they would come and ship with us we would
give them 5 cents reduction from the tariff, and in order
to get them we had to promise to do it for a year—I think
until the first of July of this year, 1902.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Continuing, the witness admitted the illegality of the
transaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Morton.</span> Yes, sir; it is an illegal contract. It
was illegal when we made it, and we knew that.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner Clements.</span> Can you tell how much
you paid out in a year?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Morton.</span> On this business?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Clements.</span> Yes, sir. Have you any idea whether it
is $50,000 or $100,000 or $10,000—anything definite?
Of course it is a mere guess and you do not know—</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Morton.</span> Well, I think there was a great deal more
than any sum you mention paid out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Clements.</span> By your company?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Morton.</span> By all the companies. I think we paid out
$50,000 a year or more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Clements.</span> Who would have the direction of that?
Who would see that it was paid? Who would direct it to
be done?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Morton.</span> I would.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner Prouty.</span> How much does it cost your
company on all its business in any one year to deviate from
the published rates?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Morton.</span> I should think between $500,000 and
$1,000,000 a year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By means of private cars, mileage payments, rebates, and
control of rates, the big packers had advantages which
enabled them to ruin the smaller packers all over the
country. The Lincoln, Neb., Packing Company, for example,
was “driven out of business,” the manager says,
“by freight discrimination, rebates, and the private car.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>After doing a losing business for 5 or 6 years against these
odds, the company closed down with a loss of 75 percent
of the investment.” And this is a fair sample of what has
happened to many, many of the competitors of the Beef
Trust.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The low rates in favor of foreign goods and of domestic
goods intended for export amount to a serious discrimination.
Paul Morton told the United States Industrial Commission
that goods were carried from Hamburg to Denver
for less than the rates from Chicago to Denver.<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a> Complaint
was made many years ago that the Pennsylvania
Railroad and other roads charged lower rates, even 50 percent
lower, on goods shipped in from foreign countries
than on domestic traffic of the same sort. Investigation
revealed in some cases a far greater difference than 50
percent.</p>

<p class='c007'>At one time the rate on tin plate from Liverpool via
Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Railroad to Chicago
was 24 cents a hundred, while the rate from Philadelphia
over the same road was 28 cents.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Texas and Pacific Case the record showed that
books, buttons, carpets, clothing, etc., were carried from
England, via New Orleans to San Francisco for $1.07 a
hundred, while the same articles of domestic manufacture
paid $2.88 on the same trains from New Orleans to Frisco.
Boots and shoes, cashmere, confectionery, cutlery, gloves,
hats and caps, laces and linens, etc., took the same blanket
rate of $1.07 from Liverpool and London to San Francisco,
while similar American goods paid the railroads $3.70 a
hundred from New Orleans to California. In some cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the railroads received only ⅙ as much for the transportation
of foreign goods as for domestic goods. The Interstate
Commission held that “any difference in charge between
foreign and domestic traffic is unlawful,” and ordered the
discrimination to cease, but after long litigation the United
States Supreme Court decided that among the circumstances
and conditions to be considered in judging rates are
the conditions of ocean traffic and water competition to
interior ports in the United States, etc., so that a carrier
may be justified in making low rates to secure foreign
freights which would otherwise go by competitive routes or
not go at all.<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c012'><sup>[114]</sup></a> The practical result appears to be that railroads
may nullify the protective tariff and discriminate in
favor of foreign shipments to any extent that is necessary
to make them move, regardless of the question whether or
no they ought to move under such conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Foreign manufacturers cannot only ship their goods
across the country more cheaply than our manufacturers
can, or at least such of them as pay schedule rates, but can
also get special rates on all raw materials they buy here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>and ship over our lines for export. For example, a Chicago
miller pays 21 cents per one hundred lbs. to get either
wheat or flour to New York, while the English miller can
buy wheat in Chicago and take it to New York for 13 cents.
In some cases the rate on flour has been as much as 11
cents more than the rate on wheat. Since 2 or 3 cents a
hundred lbs. is a good profit, our millers cannot grind for
export against the English millers.<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c012'><sup>[115]</sup></a> The railroads turn
down our millers and establish a protective tariff for free
trade England, protecting her millers against competition.</p>

<p class='c007'>American shippers take such advantage of the low export
rates as they can, but sometimes these concessions are made
to the shippers in one city and not to those of other cities;
for example, the railroads carrying export flour from Minneapolis
at a discount refused similar concessions to shippers
at intermediate points.<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c012'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Discriminations between localities, though less pronounced
in this period than in the first, were nevertheless
multitudinous and vital.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1896 the railroads carried Minneapolis flour to New
York for 10 cents a hundred, while charging New York
State millers 18 cents a hundred to New York City.</p>

<p class='c007'>President Stickney of the Chicago and Great Western
Railroad, in a discussion the same year with the representatives
of other western roads before the I. C. C., said:
“You charge the Kansas and Nebraska farmer 13 cents
to haul his grain 200 miles while you charge the grain
dealer 6 cents to haul that same grain twice as far to
Chicago.... I have been acquainted with this northwestern
country for thirty-five years. In all that time there
has never been a year that the corn crop was moved until
after the corn was in the hands of dealers who had the rate.
Once the farmer is compelled to sell his grain, then you
fellows cut the rate for the dealer.” That is, the railroads
charge the farmer shipping to the Missouri River a mileage
rate 4 times as high as the rate to the dealers shipping to
Chicago, and freeze out the small dealers from shipping to
Chicago by making secret rates in favor of the big dealers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coal was shipped from Chicago to Omaha and then
reshipped to Grinnell, Ia., 225 miles back toward Chicago,
more cheaply than it could be got direct from Chicago.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A large manufacturing establishment located in the
latter town, making agricultural implements which were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>sold principally on the Pacific Coast, found it advantageous
to abandon its plant and transfer its machinery and
employees to Chicago on account of the unfavorable rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A large factory for making barbed wire, located in the
city of Des Moines, in like manner abandoned its buildings
and transferred its establishment to Chicago, finding that
it saved a large sum on every carload of wire it shipped,
although the wire was mainly carried directly by or
through its old location, 300 miles nearer the Pacific Coast
than Chicago.”<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c012'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To certain towns in Nebraska and other States the railways
have extended the same rates that apply to Missouri
River points, where the rates to Chicago are very low, while
other towns in the same region have to pay the Missouri

<p class='c007'>The extent to which railroads sometimes go in place
discriminations is shown by cases cited in Cator and Lewis.
One of the towns on the route of the Northern Pacific in
Montana incurred the displeasure of the railway authorities,
and they determined to ruin it and build up a new
town. So they refused to stop their trains in the town or
have a depot there. The railroad built a new depot on
lands of its own, 3 miles beyond, and ran its trains through
the old town to the new site, thereby feeding its revenge
and enhancing the value of its own land at the same time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>at the cost of ruining the town already established. The
courts sustained the railroad’s claim that it had a right to
run through to the new depot, though some of the judges
dissented, regarding such favor as despotic and destructive
of public rights.<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c012'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“A town in the State of Iowa, which had thriven under
reasonable railroad facilities, was almost depopulated by a
change of ownership of the railroad line upon which it
depended.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As the result of discrimination forty American families
were driven out of this small town in a single year. Their
property was rendered almost worthless, and with great
pecuniary loss from no fault of their own they were obliged
to abandon their homes and seek new habitations and new
avocations. Cases like this were abundant throughout the
West. This merely illustrates what was going on in a
dozen great States where cities, towns, and villages were
being depopulated or their business establishments placed
at great disadvantage by reason of iniquitous discriminations.”<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c012'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Peopled flocked into the towns and cities favored with
the low rates, and when the competitive rates were removed,
as they have been in many cases, the boom towns collapsed,
and the inflated building and business interests shrunk to
skin and bone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Better accommodations are frequently accorded to places
in which the railway or its officers are interested than to
other places. When a new road is projected there are
usually town-lot and land companies along the lines, in
which prominent officials of the road may be directly or
indirectly interested. Their knowledge of the future location
of the road is utilized in purchasing tracts of land at
low values to be used for town sites and sold at high prices
after the railway is built.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“Sometimes the entire road becomes a land-grabbing
scheme with a town-lot speculation attachment. The
western half of one of the principal roads in Iowa was
built mainly on this plan. Its natural route was along
one of the old stage roads running through the county
seats of the counties through which it must pass. About
these towns was a well-settled country, with rich farms
well improved for that early day. The towns were moderate
in size, but had been established as trading points for
many years, and stores, schools, and churches had grown up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But there was a belt of government land lying between
the two belts of settlement about the respective county
seats, which the road coveted, and if the line passed
through the old towns there would be little chance for the
speculative directors to profit by laying out town sites. So
the road was laid out and built through the unsettled lands,
avoiding every old town on its route.”<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c012'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes discriminations are made by the use of different
classifications for local and through traffic.<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c012'><sup>[122]</sup></a> The rate
on sugar from San Francisco to Kearney, Neb., was 77

Omaha.<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c012'><sup>[123]</sup></a> The rate on lumber from Wilmington to Philadelphia

Portsmouth or Norfolk to Philadelphia or Boston.<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c012'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The rates from the East to St. Cloud, Minn., were
higher than to St. Paul and other more distant points.
The difference against St. Cloud was 7 cents per hundred
on flour and 75 to 85 per ton on coal. This difference was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>two or three times the profit made by the miller, so that
the price of wheat in St. Cloud was 6 cents below the price
in Minneapolis or Princeton or Elk River, and the value
of land about St. Cloud was thereby greatly lessened.<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c012'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A canning factory in Emporia, Kansas, had good natural
advantages and an excellent trade in Kansas, Colorado,
Texas, etc., when in 1891 the freight rates were changed
on the basis of water and rail competition via Galveston so
that canned goods could be shipped into this territory from
New York at rates that drove the Emporia factory out of
business with a loss of $50,000 and the ruin of the owner
who had been the heaviest tax payer in the county.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Emporia furniture factory, and the Emporia stockyards
have also been ruined, it is said, by freight discriminations.
In the Spokane case the rate to Portland, 2056
miles from the East, was $30 a ton, while the rate to Spokane,
only 1512 miles, was $52 per ton. The Commission
said this was unreasonable. “If a rate of 1½ cents per ton-mile
yielded a desirable margin over the cost, a rate of 3½
cents pays an unwarranted return.” In a Georgia case it
appeared that the rate from Cincinnati to a non-competitive
town, Marietta, was 6 times as much per ton-mile as
the rate to Atlanta. The business men of Spokane paid
2 or 3 times as much for haulage as the men of Portland,
and the business men of Marietta paid 6 times as much in
proportion as those in Atlanta.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Spokane merchants combined and put their freight
business in the hands of one agent, who could swing every
pound of freight to the Northern Pacific or to the Oregon
Navigation Co., or to the Great Northern, etc. Then the
railways pooled against the merchants. The latter adopted
the policy of tendering a reasonable sum for freight, and if
the railways wouldn’t take it, the merchants replevied the
goods and left the companies to sue for the freight. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>companies got tired of that and made some concessions.
But Spokane still suffers from severe discrimination, as we
shall see hereafter. Coal hauled fifty miles to Leadville
sold there for $7 a ton, while in Denver, after an additional
haul of 150 miles, the same coal was sold for $5.50
a ton. The Michigan Central and other roads charged
higher rates on carriages and buggies to San Bernardino
than to Los Angeles, some distance further on.<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c012'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>From Pittsburg to Colorado the rate on rails was $1.60,
while the rate all the way through to San Francisco was
only 66 cents. From Pueblo to San Francisco, 1,559 miles,
the rate on bar iron and on rails was $1.60 per hundred,
while from Chicago to San Francisco, 2,418 miles, the rates
were 50 cents on bar iron and 60 cents on rails; and even
from New York to San Francisco the same rate of 60 cents
was made for rails.<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c012'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes the charge is much greater going one way
between two given points than it is going the other way
between the same points. For instance, “Gloves from San
Francisco to Denver pay $2 a hundred. You ship the
same packages back from Denver, which has 5,000 feet of
elevation, to San Francisco at the sea level, downhill, like a
toboggan slide, and it is $3 a hundred downhill to $2 up.”<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c012'><sup>[128]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>The discriminations against Denver are severe both from
Eastern and Western points. Sugar is carried from San
Francisco to Denver at 75 cents; to Loveland it is 93 cents;
but hundreds of miles further on, to Omaha, it is only 50
cents.<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c012'><sup>[129]</sup></a> “Mr. Kindel has been driven out of the manufacture
of upholstering goods and of spring beds in Denver
because of similar differences. He wished to manufacture
albums in Denver, but was forced to locate in Chicago
because the freight rate on books from Chicago to San Francisco
was $1.75 per hundred and from Denver to San Francisco
$3, while the Denver manufacturer had to pay 97 cents
freight on his raw material (paper, etc.) from Chicago to
Denver, $3.97 against $1.75. So too, the freight rate on
books from Chicago to New York is 75 cents, from Denver
to New York $2.72.”<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c012'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“The difference in rates on coal oil has been so great
that oil has sometimes been shipped from Chicago to San
Francisco and back again to Denver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boots and shoes are carried from Chicago to Colorado
common points at $2.05 per hundred, from Chicago to California
at $1.50 per hundred. If a jobber in Colorado wishes
to ship boots and shoes to California he must pay $3,
making a total freight rate of $5.05 from Chicago to California
in this way. Cotton-piece goods under commodity
rates are shipped from Boston to the Missouri River for 52
cents per hundred, while the rate from the Missouri River
to Denver is $1.25 for a haul of one-third the distance.
The rate from the Missouri River through Denver to California
is only $1.”<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c012'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>No wonder a Denver manufacturer said to the Industrial
Commission: “My city, Denver, and State, Colorado, and
all the territory embraced in the one hundred and fifth
meridian section, are violently discriminated against by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>railroads and express company. We are denied commercial
equality, which forbids the development of our resources.
Our freight rates are anywhere from 100 to 300 percent
higher per ton per mile than those of our Eastern and
Western competitors.”<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c012'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Such conditions tend to force dealers to points on the
Missouri River or east of it. The shipper at St. Joseph on
the Missouri River, for example, can get goods from Chicago
at 80 cents and reship to San Francisco for $1.50, while the
Denver shipper must pay $2 from Chicago to Denver and
$3 from Denver to San Francisco,—$5 for the Denver
shipper against $2.30 for the St. Joseph man.<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c012'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <span class='large'>LONG-HAUL DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The long-haul clause did not realize the intent of its
framers. It received a series of shocks from the United
States Supreme Court, which produced, if not paralysis, at
least a bad case of nervous prostration.<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c012'><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>At first, believing that the law would be enforced in
accordance with its purpose and intent to get rid of unjust
and needless discrimination between localities, the Northern
and Western roads revised their tariffs in good faith in
reference to long and short haul rates, but, later, when they
found that the Supreme Court did not intend to enforce
the 4th section, they joined the Southern roads in practical
disregard of it wherever they found it convenient to do so,
and only in a few cases has their disregard been checked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within 5 days after the Commission was appointed a
large number of railroads applied for relief from the long
and short haul clause; and in many cases, on the ground of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>water competition, etc., relief was given.<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c012'><sup>[135]</sup></a> The Commission
held that dissimilar circumstances existed under the 4th
section in case of competition with water carriers, or railroads
not under the Act (foreign railroads and railroads
lying wholly within a single State), and in “rare and peculiar
cases of competition between interstate railroads, when
a strict application of the rule would be destructive of
legitimate competition,”<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c012'><sup>[136]</sup></a> but ordinarily competition between
interstate roads was not regarded as sufficient to
relieve them from the 4th section.</p>

<p class='c007'>In November, 1892, the Commission decided the famous
Alabama Midland Case. The complaint was that rates
from the East and Northeast to Troy, Ala., were higher than
to Montgomery, a longer haul passing through Troy. The
railroads pleaded competition at Montgomery. The Commission
held that railway competition would not justify
departure from the rule of Section 4 of the Interstate Act.
Five years later, in November, 1897, the United States
Supreme Court sustained the judgment of the Circuit Court
and Circuit Appeals Court, overruling the Commission, and
held that the existence of railway competition at Montgomery
made a substantial difference of circumstances
within the meaning of the exception in Section 4.<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c012'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Court held that competition even of interstate lines
is a substantial difference of conditions which may justify
a greater charge for a short than for a long haul, but said,
“We do not hold that the mere fact of competition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>no matter what its character or extent, necessarily relieves
the carrier from the restraints of the 3rd and 4th
sections.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the 2d section, which prohibits any rebate or discrimination
and is intended to enforce equality of shippers
over the same line, “‘similar circumstances and conditions’
refers to matters of carriage, and does not include competition
between rival routes;” but in the 3d and 4th
sections “similar circumstances and conditions” includes
competition, which “is one of the most obvious and effective
circumstances that make the conditions under which
a long and short haul is performed, and substantially dissimilar.”
The railroad people think the circumstances are
very dissimilar also when the Oil Trust or the Beef Combine
threatens to take hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of business if they don’t get the rates and facilities
they want, while Messrs. A. B. C., etc., ship their goods and
pay the schedule rates without suggesting any reduction.
This dissimilarity is harder for the railroads to deal with
than the other. They can stop competing among themselves
on long-haul schedule rates more easily than they can
enforce equal rates on the big shippers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Chattanooga Case it appeared that rates from New
York and other points via South Atlantic points to Chattanooga
were higher than to Nashville, 152 miles further on.
The Commission in December, 1892, ordered this discrimination
to cease. The order was not obeyed. Suit to enforce
it was brought in the Circuit Court, and a decision sustaining
the Commission was rendered in February, 1898. And
in November, 1899, the Court of Appeals confirmed the
decision, holding that the ruling of the Supreme Court in
the Midland Case did not apply, because “normal competition”
would give Chattanooga the same rates as Nashville.<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c012'><sup>[138]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>But the Supreme Court in 1901 reversed the lower courts
and decided against the Commission.<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c012'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Georgia Railroad Commission Cases, also decided by
the Interstate Commission in 1892, went the same way, the
United States Supreme Court again deciding against the
Interstate Commission on the long and short haul clause,
holding that any substantial competition of markets or railways
creates dissimilar conditions within the 4th section.<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c012'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The result is that dissimilarity of conditions created by
the railroads themselves becomes the means of freeing them
from the long-haul rule of the 4th section of the Interstate
Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the South a method called the “basing-point system”
is in vogue. The railroads name certain towns as distributing
centres and competing points, fix the rates to and from
these points, and make rates to and from other localities by
adding to such through rates the local charges in force
between the distributing centres, or “basing-points” and
the said other localities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Commission says: “Our annual reports to Congress
and reported decisions in cases have uniformly condemned
this distributing centre theory of rate-making, but the
Southern carriers have resisted our efforts to correct the
practice.”<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c012'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A thoughtful writer in the <cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite>
says: “The most serious class of unjust discriminations
includes those which have for their victims the entire populations
of towns, cities, and even extensive districts, which
are made to suffer from the unfair adjustment of railway
rates. Practically the whole region south of the Potomac
and Ohio and east of the Mississippi has continuously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>suffered from discriminations of this kind through the
system of making charges to a few selected cities the basis
for through rates to all other points. Through rates are
made to and from about two hundred of the larger towns,
including Atlanta, Birmingham, Chattanooga, Vicksburg,
New Orleans, and Mobile, and traffic shipped from or to
all other points is charged the rate to one of these basing-points
plus the local rate from such basing-points to final
destination. In practice it is common to make the combination
by the use of rates to and beyond whatever
basing-point will give the lowest total, whether on the line
traversed by the shipment or not. Thus a shipment from
Cincinnati to a point on the line from that city to New
Orleans may be charged the full rate to New Orleans plus
that from the latter back to the local point. The condemnation
of such a system cannot be too severe. It not only
limits the commercial activities of the towns unjustly discriminated
against and restricts the sources from which
they can directly draw supplies, but by hindering their
growth it retards the development of the entire section,
including the cities supposed to be favored.”<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c012'><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In a case decided in 1894 it was found that hay was
being carried from Memphis through Summerville to
Charleston for 19 cents a hundred, against 28 cents a hundred
from Memphis to Summerville, the 9 cents difference
being equal to the local rate from Charleston back to Summerville.
“The difference of $1.80 per ton was sufficient
to preclude the Summerville dealer from selling in neighboring
towns in competition with Charleston dealers. The
Summerville dealer was thus practically confined to Summerville
for a market, and even there had to compete with
dealers doing business at Charleston 19 miles away. If
$3.80 per ton is profitable to the carriers for bringing hay
in carloads from Memphis to Charleston, then $5.60 per
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>ton, nearly 50 percent more, from Memphis to Summerville,
which is nearer than Charleston is to Memphis, represents
an extra profit of $1.80, which the carrier did not
and could not show to be equalled by extra cost of transporting
a car of hay and delivering the same at Memphis.”
The Commission (June 1894) ordered the carriers not to
charge more from Memphis to Summerville than from
Memphis to Charleston, holding that competition of markets
or of railways would not justify a higher charge for a
shorter than for a longer haul. The order was made in
September. In its report to Congress in December the
Commission said, “The order has not been obeyed.”<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c012'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Social Circle, situated between Atlanta and Augusta in
Georgia, was required to pay a rate from Cincinnati made
up of the rate to Atlanta plus the local rate from Atlanta
to Social Circle, while Augusta, considerably more distant,
had rates from Cincinnati no higher than those to Atlanta.
The Commission in June, 1891, ordered the railroad to cease
charging more from Cincinnati to Social Circle than for the
longer distance to Augusta.<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c012'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Hill and Brother, in the wholesale grain, flour, and hay
business at Cordele, Ga., were in competition with dealers
at Albany, Americus, and Macon, which were made basing-points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>and had lower rates than Cordele from the common
source of supply. Cordele was shown to be nearer the
coast than the other points, and to have several railway
routes from Nashville, so that it could not be excluded
from the low rate list on competitive grounds. The railroad
men said it was excluded because it was not so large a
distributing point as the other places, but admitted that if it
had equally low rates it would largely increase as a distributing
centre; so that the case stood thus: The railroads did
not give Cordele equally low rates because it was not a
sufficiently large distributing centre, and it was not a sufficiently
large distributing centre because it was denied
equally low rates; <em>i. e.</em>, the railroads sought to excuse themselves
for wrongdoing by offering the results of the wrong
in justification. The Commission refused to allow the
railroads to take advantage of their own wrong and condemned
the Cordele rates.<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c012'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Louisville and Nashville charged $3.69 per ton on
pig iron from Birmingham, Ala., to Cordele, Ga., 267
miles, and only $1.80 a ton from Birmingham to Macon,
332 miles. On coal the rate was $2.60 to Cordele and
$1.60 to Macon. The Commission decided that the rates
to Cordele should be no higher than to Macon.<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c012'><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>La Grange is 71 miles nearer New Orleans than Atlanta,
yet the rates to La Grange were made so much higher
than to Atlanta that an Atlanta dealer could ship goods
from New Orleans through to Atlanta and then back to
La Grange as cheaply as the goods could be shipped direct
to La Grange.<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c012'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>To keep traffic from going to Savannah and make it go

made very high rates on shipments to Savannah. On
Savannah traffic the Nashville haul was short and the receipts
small; on shipments to the Northwest the Nashville
receipts were much larger, and in Pensacola it had a special
interest. So the Savannah cotton rate was advanced from
$2.75 to $3.30 a bale, and the rates on naval stores were
also made much higher than to Pensacola or to the Northwest.<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c012'><sup>[148]</sup></a>

<p class='c006'>In “A Decade of Federal Railway Regulation,” after
describing various forms of discrimination, H. T. Newcomb
says: “The conditions described are fairly typical of those
existing all over the United States. The Interstate Commerce
Law has mitigated but slightly, if at all, the evil
of unjust discrimination between individuals, has in but
few and relatively insignificant instances moderated unjust
discriminations between articles or classes of traffic, and
has almost wholly failed to remedy the far more serious
inequities in rate-making, which operate to the disadvantage
of towns, cities, or districts.”<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c012'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In 1897 the President of the Big Four Railway said:
“Never in the history of railways have tariffs been so little
respected as to-day. Private arrangements and understandings
are more plentiful than regular rates. The larger
shippers, the irresponsible shippers, are obtaining advantages
which must sooner or later prove the ruin of smaller
and more conservative traders, and in the end will break
up many of the commercial houses in this country and
ruin the railways. A madness seems to have seized upon
some railway managers, and a large portion of the freight
of the country is being carried at prices far below cost....
There is a much more dangerous view, and that is the demoralization
of the men conducting these numerous enterprises
and the want of respect for the law which is being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>developed by the present situation.... There is less faith
to-day between railway managers, with reference to their
agreements to maintain tariffs, than was probably ever
known on earth in any other business. Men managing
large corporations who would trust their opponent with
their pocket-book with untold thousands in it, will hardly
trust his agreement for the maintenance of tariffs while
they are in the room together. Good faith seems to have
departed from the railway world, so far as traffic agreements
are concerned.”<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c012'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Texas Railway Commission in 1897 started suits
against several railways for discriminations, and before
the end of the year three railways pleaded guilty in
95 cases and paid fines amounting to $47,500, promising
to “be good.” The next year $20,000 more were
paid by the railways as fines in 20 cases for violation
of this law in Texas. Many other cases pending.<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c012'><sup>[156]</sup></a> In the
1898 Report the Commission says that express and railway
agents do a business as shippers of fruit, etc., and
discriminate against the business of other shippers by
underbilling their own shipments and by delaying the
other shipments.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most striking illustrations of the effectiveness
of the Interstate Act is to be found in the results of the
Boston and Albany investigation in 1900, during the consideration
of the question of leasing the road to the New
York Central. The Interstate Act made it a misdemeanor
to depart from the published rates, but the railroad followed
the law only when it was convenient to do so, and most of
the rates in actual use constituted misdemeanors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Various shippers, merchants, manufacturers, etc., were
visited, and it was found that the local rates were not followed,
that shippers were receiving widely varying discounts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>from the published rates, and that shippers did
not know at all what rates their competitors and neighbors
were getting. They were not satisfied with the
system, but they were afraid to complain, for if they
made complaint they would lose whatever advantages
they possess and become marked men for railway persecution.
The Railroad Commission of Massachusetts advertised
for shippers who were not satisfied to come and
make complaint; but they did not do so, for the reason
that any shipper who complained of a railroad would be
apt to fare a good deal worse afterwards than before; his
goods would be delayed, his facilities would be cut off
and whatever reductions he was getting would be stopped,
and he would have to pay the full published rates. He
might also be involved in costly litigation, and he did not
dare to say anything.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Railroad Commission was asked by the legislature
about these discriminations on the Boston and Albany, and
a report was handed in by the Commission (1900) saying
that the reductions from the published rates averaged 40
percent, and that in different cases they ran from 10 to
about 73 percent—fully confirming what the shippers had
said. It was admitted, however, that this report was not
written by the Railroad Commission. They had passed the
question over to the Boston and Albany, and a high official
of the road had written the reply. The Railroad Commission
admitted that they did not know anything about it.
They, however, handed in the report of the railroad official
as being true, and it was admitted, both by the railroad, and
by the Commission, that these discounts on local rates were
being given. The railroad official claimed that the special
rates were ‘open to all shippers sending freight under similar
circumstances and conditions,’ which may be true if we
understand circumstances and conditions’ to include the
relations of the shipper to the managers, and his pull with
the railroad, but cannot in any other way be made to square
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>with the statements of shippers and the other evidences in
the case.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While favored shippers were receiving discounts of 10
percent to 73 percent from the published rates, other shippers,
and some doing considerable business, declared that
they got no discount at all. During the legislative investigation
the matter was put to Samuel Hoar, attorney and
director of the Boston and Albany, and he said: “I suppose
it is true that no shipper knows what his rival is getting. I
suppose it is true. But what of it? What has that to do
with the lease?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The receipts per ton-mile on all classes of freight were
less than one-half the average of the published rates to the
various stations on the road for the cheapest class of freight,
viz., coal. And the lowest published local rate on coal was
higher than the average rate on all commodities.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The interstate-commerce law was passed in 1887 and
the Interstate Commerce Commission was established to
abolish the evils of unjust discrimination, but the work has
not been accomplished. The Interstate Commerce Commission
has told us year after year that the discriminations
are still going on; and that they cannot be stopped under
present laws at least.”<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c012'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. George R. Blanchard of New York, former commissioner
of the Joint Traffic Association told the Industrial
Commission<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c012'><sup>[158]</sup></a> that “Discriminations against persons result
from secret rebates, combination of rates on inward material
and outward products, so as to affect the through charges;
favoritisms in terminal facilities; quicker time in transit;
unequal or hidden allowances in weights; dissimilar storage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>periods in cars or warehouses; preferences in supplying
cars; differences in special charges, such as switching,
loading or unloading, or in cartage allowances; the leasing
of elevators to or making elevator contracts with large
handlers of grain, to their exceptional advantage; the
grant of undue allowances under the fictitious guise of
commissions, etc.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Summing up the evidence gathered in its great investigation,
1900–1901, the United States Industrial Commission
concludes that the main effect of the Interstate Act has
been to concentrate the benefits of discrimination in fewer
hands,<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c012'><sup>[159]</sup></a> which tends to build up trusts and combines. It
found discriminations everywhere prevailing. It says:
“There is a general consensus of opinion among practically
all witnesses, including members of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, representatives of shippers, and railway
officers, that the railways still make discriminations between
individuals, and perhaps to as great an extent as before.
In fact, it is stated by numerous witnesses that discriminations
were probably worse during the year 1898 than at
any previous time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is claimed that direct rebates and secret rates are
still frequently granted; commissions are paid for securing
freight; goods are billed at less than the actual weight;
traffic within a State not subject to the Interstate Commerce
Act is carried at lower rates; allowances and advantages
are made in handling and storing, etc. Several
witnesses refer to the practice of shipping goods under a
false classification. Sometimes this is done without the
knowledge of the railways, but in other cases they apparently
connive. Thus fine hardware may be shipped as
some low-class kind of iron.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The representatives of the railways declare that so long
as competition exists the attempt to get traffic by secret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>rates must continue. It is thought generally that there
has been a considerable improvement in the situation during
the year 1899.... In the latter part of 1898, Messrs.
Cowen and Murray, receivers of the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad, addressed a letter to the Interstate Commerce
Commission declaring that the practice of granting rates
below the published tariffs was so general as seriously to
reduce the revenue of the railroads. More than 50 percent
of the traffic, at least on certain roads, was affected. The
receivers expressed a determination to coöperate in the
enforcement of the law. Later, conferences were held
between the Interstate Commerce Commission and railway
officers, which led to a general attempt to reduce the extent
of the evil. Many witnesses, however, including representatives
of the railroads, think that the improvement is only
temporary, and that when the present rush of traffic has
ceased discriminating rates will be granted more and
more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The investigations of the last five years show that these
witnesses were right in thinking the cessation of hostilities
to be only a temporary truce.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ELKINS ACT AND ITS EFFECTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The “Elkins Act,” approved Feb. 19, 1903, amended
the Interstate Act in some important particulars. It provides
that any failure to publish rates and charges, or any
departure from the published tariffs, or any offer or grant
of any discrimination, rebate, concession, or device of any
kind whereby transportation is obtained at a less rate than
the tariffs published and filed with the Commission, shall
be a misdemeanor of the corporation as well as of the
officers or agents concerned. Every shipper also who solicits
or accepts any such rebate, concession, or discrimination
is guilty of a misdemeanor. In each case, whether the
suit is against the railway company, or its officials, or a
shipper, the punishment is a fine of $1,000 to $20,000 for
each offence, the imprisonment clause of the Interstate Act
being repealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under these provisions the railroad companies themselves
may be attacked, in addition to the suits against the guilty
officials provided for by the Interstate Act, and shippers
may be convicted by showing that by any device they have
obtained a lower rate than the published rate, without
proving that some one else paid more than the defendant, as
was formerly necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The act also expressly authorizes the United States Circuit
courts to restrain by injunction or other appropriate
process any departure from published rates, or any discrimination
forbidden by law, without prejudice to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>bringing of suits for damages or other action under the
Commerce Act. And it further declares that “in proceedings
under this act and the acts to regulate commerce, the
said courts shall have the power to compel the attendance
of witnesses, both upon the part of the carrier and the
shipper, who shall be required to answer on all subjects
relating directly or indirectly to the matter in controversy,
and to compel the production of all books and papers, both
of the carrier and the shipper, which relate directly or indirectly
to such transaction; the claim that such testimony
or evidence may tend to criminate the person giving such
evidence shall not excuse such person from testifying or
such corporation from producing its books and papers, but
<em>no person shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or
forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or
thing concerning which he may testify or produce evidence,
documentary or otherwise, in such proceeding</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This is considered one of the best railroad measures so
far enacted. It is said by many that direct rebates have
practically ceased since its passage, and some declare that
it has stopped all sorts of discriminations.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Mr. Bacon, an important witness from Milwaukee,
was speaking to the Senate Committee, 1905, of which
Senator Elkins was chairman, the following conversation
took place regarding the Elkins Act.<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c012'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Elkins.</span> The Pennsylvania Railroad has not
given a rebate since the act was passed, and they do not
want to. It has been a benefit to the railroads, don’t you
think so?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Bacon.</span> It has benefited the railroads, by millions
of dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Elkins.</span> I mean the good railroads.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Bacon.</span> It will undoubtedly effect a saving of
upwards of a hundred million dollars a year.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Mr. Prouty of the Interstate Commission said to the
Boston Economic Club in March, 1905: “The Elkins Bill
is one of the most beneficent measures touching railway
regulation of recent times. I have no words of commendation
too strong for that measure; but this bill, which has
very largely stopped the payment of rebates, as such, was
a railroad measure, conceived by the railroads, passed by
the railroads, and in the interest of the railroads, and no
one thing in recent times has put into the treasuries of
railways of this country more money than that same
enactment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Senator Elkins who drew the bill is the political “boss”
of West Virginia. He is director of a railroad that belongs
to the Pennsylvania system and is otherwise identified with
railroad interests. He acted in harmony with leading
railroads in drawing the bill. In fact, it is said on high
authority that it was framed in the office of A. J. Cassatt,
President of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The law is in
many respects a good one, although there is a clause in it
which may protect the railroads from the consequences of
wrongdoing, and it is thought by many that the real effect
of the law has not yet become apparent. Railroad managers
do undoubtedly desire to protect themselves from
the importunities of shippers to whom they do not wish
to give concessions, and to be free from the danger of
imprisonment, and so far as possible from any danger,
in case they are caught giving preferences to persons or
companies in whose property they or their railroads have
a special interest. The Elkins Act accomplished all these
purposes. It is claimed that the words italicized in the
above quotation from the act will prevent the prosecution
of any officer or road on account of any cause in respect
to which they give evidence or produce books. In other
words, they can only be prosecuted where the discrimination
or departure from schedule rates can be proved without
their help. Commissioner Prouty says: “I have no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>doubt that rebates to a greater or less extent are paid in
many parts of this country. And if it turns out, as the
railroads contend, that the disclosure by any officer of a
railroad gives the company its exemption under the Elkins
Bill your law is good for nothing. They can resume the
payment of rebates whenever they desire.”<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c012'><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The fact is, apparently, that for some months after the
act was passed the railroads in large measure discontinued
rebates and some other notorious forms of discrimination,
just as they did for some months after the Interstate Act
was passed in 1887. The abuses “grew up again afterwards,
and almost every 1st of January, from that time
down to this, these railroad gentlemen get together and
make a gentlemen’s agreement that they will quit and
reform and turn a new leaf and not do it any more. They
break down again and make a resolution again. They are
now under a good resolution.”<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c012'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the sweeping declarations of railway men and
others about discriminations, and especially about rebates,
are as follows:<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c012'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“All stopped.” “Eliminated.” “Almost annihilated
since Elkins Law” (February, 1903). “Almost entirely
wiped out.” “Have known of no such payments for over
12 years.” “Do not know of any in last three years.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Have not had any for about 20 years.” “Never had
any.” “Know of none.” “Have been practically abandoned.”
“Past issue.” “Have no knowledge of.” “No
complaints of.” “None so far as I know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the witnesses give the railways a clean bill of
character and even put a coat of whitewash over the record
of the Standard Oil from 1887 on. Mr. Hiland, head of
the traffic department of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St.
Paul, says: “Unjust discriminations and rebates have
ceased.”<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c012'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Bird, Vice-President of the Gould lines, says: “I
believe there are no rebates paid.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Chairman.</span> And discriminations?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Bird.</span> No secret discriminations. There may be
discriminations that are open and published in the tariffs....
I do not believe that the Standard Oil Company has
received a rebate since 1887.... I do not believe that the
beef trusts are getting rebates.”<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c012'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Brown, counsel for the Santa Fe, said: “My sole
purpose in appearing here is to put on record a sweeping
denial that the A. T. and S. F. Company has made any
discriminatory rates or paid any rebates.”<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c012'><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Biddle, traffic manager of the Santa Fe, was not
quite so sweeping. He said: “It is true that rebates have
been paid, although personally I have not known of any
such payments for over twelve years.”<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c012'><sup>[167]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A more impressive mass of negative evidence could
hardly have been secured, even if the Commission had
selected the witnesses with a view to their ignorance of
rebates and kindred manœuvres. It is peculiarly fortunate,
just at this time, to have the statements of so many who
seem to have refrained from associating with rebates or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>seeing any discriminations, in view of the vigorous anti-rebate
remarks of President Roosevelt in his recent messages
to Congress, asking for further legislation to check
railroad abuses. The President is under the impression
that rebates and other evils still exist, but if the
Senate Committee can report to Congress that this is
a mistake it will be clear that the said new legislation
is not needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately, however, the weight of evidence is against
those who affirm the conversion of the railroads to the ways
of virtue. The cessation of discriminations is denied by a
large number of authorities including railroad men of the
highest position.<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c012'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>James J. Hill, President of the Great Northern, says
discriminations still exist and must exist. He thinks discriminations
will never cease, and declares that railroads
“have to discriminate.”<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c012'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Victor Morawetz, Chairman of the Executive Committee
of the Santa Fe and its chief counsel, says that discrimination
still exists and is “bound to exist” under present
conditions. Many things the traffic managers do are not
authorized by their superiors and would not be approved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>by them, but it is understood that concessions are given
and must be given.<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c012'><sup>[170]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>President Stickney of the Chicago and Great Western
says that prior to the injunctions against paying rebates
“it was understood among business men that schedules
were made for the small shippers and those unsophisticated
enough to pay the established rates,” and since the injunctions
the knowledge of the traffic directors has been exerted
in “the problem of how to pay rebates without paying
rebates.” They use “elevator fees” and “midnight schedules”
or sudden changes of tariff known beforehand to
favored shippers. These special tariffs “are of frequent
occurrence and result in greater injustice than secret
rebates.”<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c012'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Rich, the general solicitor for the B. &amp; M., said to
the Providence Economic Club, in the spring of 1905, that
75 percent of products is carried below the published
rates. He added that the rates are mostly open. The
published rates no doubt are open, but it is hard to believe
that the cut rates are mostly open. If they were, there
would be no reason for publishing rates other than those in
use. Every rate below the published tariff is a violation
of law. And it is not easy to see why the railroads
should risk multitudinous violations of law simply to
establish open rates which might be published without
interfering with any purpose that is honest. I quoted
Mr. Rich’s words to an excellent authority and he said,
“Cut rates are not open rates. Can’t make people believe
that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Senator Dolliver said:<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c012'><sup>[172]</sup></a> “A famous railway president,
speaking in this city a month ago, stated that the whole
railway practice of America was honeycombed with secret
rebates and discriminations as late as last January.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Ripley says<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c012'><sup>[173]</sup></a> that discriminations between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>localities and between commodities through classification,
etc., are still serious evils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Governor Cummins of Iowa said:<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c012'><sup>[174]</sup></a> “So long as there is
competition among the railroads in securing business, so
long they will find some way of getting that business
through favors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. C. W. Robinson, representing the New Orleans
Board of Trade, said: “The direct rebate has been stopped
by the Elkins law, but there still remains the indirect
rebate, or the almost innumerable forms of discrimination,
which are difficult to reach by legislation, and in the
practice of which some of the traffic managers are unquestionably
experts.”<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c012'><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The complaints made to the Interstate Commission in
the last few years<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c012'><sup>[176]</sup></a> and the facts brought out in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>investigations of the Interstate Commission from March,
1903, to the present time, and in the Hearings of the Senate
Committee, 1905, abundantly confirm the opinions of these
witnesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Elkins Bill became law in February, 1903. In
December of the same year the Interstate Commerce Commission
reported that they believed the payment of rebates
was largely discontinued, but that pressure upon the companies
to maintain published rates had “begotten a new
crop of expedients for the purpose of favoring particular
shippers.”<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c012'><sup>[177]</sup></a> Private-car abuses and terminal-railway
abuses especially have “grown up much more intensely and
to an aggravated degree since the Elkins Act than ever
before.”<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c012'><sup>[178]</sup></a> In 1902, in consequence of the exposure of
wholesale rebates in the dressed-meat traffic, etc., temporary
injunctions were issued against 14 leading railroads of the
West, and while the matter was still before the court the
Elkins Bill was passed, settling the injunction question in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>favor of the Commission. The railroads, convinced that
rebates were dangerous, for the time at least, turned their
attention to methods of discrimination not so subject to
injunction or other judicial disorder. To these they have
given their main allegiance, though they have by no means
abandoned the rebate.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE WISCONSIN REVELATIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In 1903, as stated in a previous chapter, Governor La
Follette began an investigation of the railroads in Wisconsin,
in relation to illegal deductions from the gross earnings
returned by them as a basis for taxation. The investigation
covered the period from 1897 to 1903, and it was found
that $10,500,000 of illegal tax deductions had been made
in that time, about $7,000,000 of which was in the form
of unlawful rebates and discriminations. Every railroad
of any importance in the State had paid rebates every year
in large amounts both on passenger traffic and freight
business. Here is a table of the rebates paid in violation
of the Interstate Commerce Act and the Elkins Law by the
leading railways in Wisconsin, so far as brought to light by
the investigation:<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c012'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

paid, and do not touch in any way the vast amount of
favoritism which does not take the rebate form nor appear
in any cash item.</p>

<p class='c007'>Part of the Wisconsin rebates were paid on State business,
but far the larger part was on interstate traffic. The
Elkins Law, instead of putting an end to the payment of
rebates, as so many railroad men have declared, had no
effect whatever, apparently, on the volume of rebates paid.
Here is the monthly record of rebates paid in 1903 by one
of the principal railroads operating in Wisconsin:</p>

<p class='c007'>The Elkins Act went into effect February 19, 1903; yet
the rebates in February and March were larger than in
January; and the rebates for July were nearly three times
the January figure. It is clear, however, that when the
light of publicity was turned on by the investigation, which
began September 29, 1903, the rebate payments that could
be checked up on the books dropped from $46,000 in September
to $9,000 in October, $666 in November, and $2,032
in December. Instead of paying cash rebates the railroads
began to issue a great many “midnight tariffs,” that is, rate
schedules printed on purpose to give favored shippers
advantages over others and then revoked or superseded
as soon as the purpose has been accomplished, so that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>midnight tariff has, in a different way, done exactly what
is done by the payment of the cash rebate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The impotency of the Elkins Law is still further shown
by the fact that the total rebates paid by the railroads in
1903 were greater than the rebates of 1902. The Northwestern
road, for example, jumped from $212,075 rebates
in 1902, before the Elkins Law, to $410,476 in 1903, mostly
after the Elkins Act took effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have seen in Chapter III how President Mosher of the
Northern Grain Company fought La Follette’s railroad reforms
because of his deep sympathy with, and appreciation
of, the rights of railroads that were paying his company
$30,000 a year in secret rebates. Another man who bitterly
opposed La Follette, denouncing him as “an inciter,”
a demagogue, etc., was an officer of one of the refrigerator
companies that carries beer for a big Milwaukee brewery.
At the very time this official condemned La Follette, his
company was receiving from one to three thousand dollars
a month in rebates from a single one of the Wisconsin
railways, in addition to the mileage profits on the cars.
No wonder the brewers and their allies opposed all
progressive railroad legislation when they were getting
$73,240 a year in mileage rentals, and many thousands
more in secret rebates or commissions from the Chicago,
Milwaukee, and St. Paul alone. These men were
strongly of opinion that there was law enough already.</p>

<p class='c007'>An investigation in Minnesota a little before that of
Wisconsin showed precisely the same sort of facts, namely,
enormous amounts in rebates were paid by the Great Northern,
the Northern Pacific, and other Minnesota railroads.
But in the Minnesota cases, to forestall further agitation
and publicity, most of the railroads paid the additional
taxes demanded by the State.</p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads do not by any means confine their rebate
operations to the States in which their lines are located.
The case of the Camden Iron Works, recently before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Interstate Commerce Commission, shows that a railroad will
reach half across the continent with a rebate in its hand to
grasp important shipments. In this case the Northern Pacific
gave R. D. Wood &amp; Co. of Philadelphia, the owners of
the Iron Works, a rebate of 5 cents a hundred on 1,500
tons of iron pipe. The Great Northern, the Canadian Pacific,
the Delaware &amp; Hudson, and other roads had agents on the
spot trying to get the business away from the Pennsylvania,
which would naturally have taken the shipment, but
the 5 cent rebate carried the day and the iron went via
the B. &amp; O., the Great Lakes, and the Northern Pacific. The
rebate was paid by a check for $1,500, and no one but the
traffic managers knew of the transaction, which would probably
never have come out except for the complaint of a
traffic agent on the Pennsylvania, who had offered a rebate
of 1 cent a hundred but did not get the business and was
therefore blamed by his superiors.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE COLORADO FUEL REBATES AND OTHER CASES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the Colorado Fuel and Iron Case, investigated by the
Commission in 1904 and 1905, it was shown that the Santa
Fe has persistently violated the Interstate Act, the Elkins
Act, and the injunctions issued by the United States Circuit
Court. The Santa Fe tariff filed with the Interstate
Commission May 24, 1903, and in effect till November 27,
1904, made the rate on coal from the Trinidad district,
Colorado, to Deming, N. M., $4.05 a ton; but Mr. Biddle,
General Traffic Manager of the Santa Fe, testified that
during all this time $1.15 of the $4.05 was always paid
back by the railroad to the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company,
a concern in which the Standard Oil people are
largely interested. Similar favors were shown the Colorado
Company in respect to shipments from its mines
at Gallup, N. M., giving that company a decided advantage
over competitors, who were obliged to pay the full
rate.<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c012'><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It made a difference, also, who was to get the coal. The
Santa Fe carried Colorado Fuel and Iron Company coal to
the El Paso and Southwestern for $2.90 a ton, while charging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>$3.45 a ton for hauling the same coal from the same
mine to the same point, Deming, when the billing was to
the Southern Pacific. The El Paso could get coal on a
rate of $2.90, while the Southern Pacific must pay $3.45
and the published tariff rate was $4.05. Anybody on the
line of the El Paso who stood in with the management
could get the $2.90 rate, while his competitors might be
paying $4.05.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Biddle testified as follows, December, 1904, in answer
to the questions of Mr. Field: “I say the freight rate we
got from the Southern Pacific was $3.45 at the time we
were accepting $2.90 on coal destined to the El Paso and
Southwestern.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> That is to say, at that time you were
charging the Southern Pacific Railroad Company $3.45
per ton for transporting coal (to Deming), when you were
charging the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad Company
only $2.90?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> And all upon a published tariff which
showed a rate of $4 to Deming?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> No; the arrangement we had with the
Southern Pacific was an agreement as to what they would
pay for their coal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> You paid no attention whatever to the
published tariffs?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> I don’t know that we published a tariff
on Southern Pacific coal at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> When you published a tariff for the information
of the public and the Interstate Commerce Commission,
it was with the reservation that you might modify
that tariff to certain consumers as suited your business?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> It didn’t apply to coal when destined to
the Southern Pacific.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> That is another way of saying that it
didn’t apply when you didn’t want it to apply.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> It means just exactly what I said it
meant. I said that the rate we published to Deming on
coal was published with the full knowledge that it did not
apply on coal destined to the Southern Pacific, or coal
going to points on the El Paso and Southwestern.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> With whose full knowledge?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> With my full knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That is to say: The law requires all rates to be published
and adhered to, so that the Commission and the public may
know what rates are being charged. The traffic manager
publishes a rate on coal, knowing that he intends to give a
secret cut rate to special customers, and then testifies that
the secret rate is no breach of the published tariff or violation
of law because the tariff was published with his full
knowledge that he wasn’t going to stick to it. The law in
such case depends entirely on what the railroad manager
whispers to himself when he issues the tariff. If the manager
says to himself, “I intend to follow this tariff which
I’m sending to the Interstate Commerce Commission,” then
a rate lower than the tariff is in violation of the law; but if
the manager says, “I intend to give the Southern Pacific
and the El Paso lower rates than this tariff shows,” then
the tariff is issued with full knowledge that it doesn’t apply
to Southern Pacific and El Paso, and cut rates to Southern
Pacific and El Paso and their customers constitute no violation
of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Caledonian Company was organized in 1888 to
operate a coal mine at Gallup, N. M., on the Santa Fe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The company sold large quantities of engine coal to the
Santa Fe. The contract expired in 1898 or 1899, and was
not renewed, the parties not being able to agree on the
price; but the Santa Fe continued to buy more or less coal
from the Caledonian till 1901. Some time previous to the
expiration of the contract, the other mines at Gallup came
under the control of the Colorado Fuel Company. An agent
of the Colorado Company asked the Caledonian manager to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>name a price on his property, but he declined to do so.
“Soon after the Colorado Company took possession of
these mines, the Santa Fe system stopped receiving engine
coal from the Caledonian Company.” The Caledonian had
a contract for engine coal with another road, the majority
of whose stock was owned by the Santa Fe. This contract
was also terminated in 1903, the manager of the road
stating that he did it, not because of any dissatisfaction,
but by direction of the purchasing agent for the Atchison.<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c012'><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Caledonian sought other markets, but found itself
handicapped by discriminating freight rates. Coal from the
Colorado Fuel Company’s mines at Trinidad and at Gallup
was being supplied at a price which just about equalled the
freight rate alone from the point of production to destination.
For example, the rate on lump coal from Gallup to
Las Cruces was $5.65, and the coal was selling at the mine
for $1.60 to $2.50 per ton; yet Gallup lump coal from the
Colorado Fuel Company’s mines was being sold in Las
Cruces for $5.65 a ton, exactly what the rival company,
the Caledonian, would have to pay in freight. The Caledonian
shipped coal to Silver City, N. M., paying the published
rate, $5.90 a ton, while the Colorado Company was
able to deliver Gallup coal at Silver City at $5.75 total for
freight and cost of coal. This was in April, 1900. Later,
the Caledonian shipped to Silver City at a rate of $5.75 per
ton, just what the Colorado sold for, freight and all. As
Gallup, Silver City, and Las Cruces are all in New Mexico,
the Interstate Act does not apply to traffic between those
points; but “Mr. Bowie (manager of the Caledonian) testified
that he had made many shipments from Gallup to
El Paso, Tex., upon which he paid the published rate,
and that he found the same competitive conditions at El
Paso and at points in Arizona and Mexico which existed
at Silver City.”<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c012'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>The result was that the Caledonian and other mines were
practically driven from the market, their business brought
to a standstill, and the Colorado Fuel Company obtained
a virtual monopoly of the trade that should have been
divided with these companies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the Senate Committee, 1905, in answer to a question
by Senator Kean about the so-called discriminations
in the matter of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company and
the Santa Fe Railroad, Mr. Hearne of the Colorado Fuel
Company said: “This matter has been brought about largely
by sensational newspapers.... The coal produced by the
Gallup people is inferior,<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c012'><sup>[183]</sup></a> carrying not more than half the
heating power of our high-grade bituminous. If the railroads
have not extended to them the same rate they have
extended to us, I presume it is because the people at Deming
and El Paso, etc., do not want that fuel at any price.”<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c012'><sup>[184]</sup></a> In
other words, the Gallup coal was so poor that the people at
Deming did not want it anyway, and so the railroad put a
prohibitive rate on it to keep the people at Deming from
buying it instead of the far superior Colorado coal which
the people were determined to buy anyway.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Santa Fe used to own and operate coal mines, but in
1896 leased them to the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company
under a contract<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c012'><sup>[185]</sup></a> supposed to cover the question of freight
rates. Afterward a circular in reference to coal rates was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>issued from the central office of the Santa Fe in Topeka.<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c012'><sup>[186]</sup></a>
It stated that coal originating at certain points (where
the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company had mines) would be
delivered when consigned to certain specified industries or
parties at prices covering both freight and cost of the coal,
which total prices might be, as we have seen, no greater
than the published freight rate alone. The circular was
headed: “This publication is for the information of employees
only, and copies must not be given to the public.”<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c012'><sup>[187]</sup></a>
And it gave notice to Santa Fe agents that the Colorado
Company’s coal shipped to points on the Santa Fe was “to
be billed at figures furnished by the Colorado Fuel and Iron
Company which will include the freight rate and the price
of coal.”<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c012'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The following questions of the I. C. C. counsel, Mr.
Field, and answers by Mr. Biddle, the general traffic manager
of the Santa Fe, are of interest in this connection:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> You did not advise the Commission that
the rate you made (on the Colorado Company’s coal) included
the price of the commodity?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> No.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> Why didn’t you?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> I didn’t consider it necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> I ask you categorically if you didn’t
do it with the intention of deceiving the Interstate Commerce
Commission and the competitors of the Colorado Fuel
and Iron Company as to that rate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> No, sir.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> What was your purpose, Mr. Biddle?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> Well, we did it for business reasons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> What were the business reasons? I want
you to tell me the reasons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> We did it for reasons we did not consider
necessary to tell; on coal to intermediate points—the
rate that we found it necessary to make to points
reached by the El Paso and Southwestern.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> You say upon your oath now, that you
did not do it for the purpose of deceiving the Interstate
Commerce Commission or the competitors of the Colorado
Fuel and Iron Company?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> Whatever answer I may make here I
am making under oath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> Do you say that is so?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> I repeat what I said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> You did not intend to conceal from the
Interstate Commerce Commission the fact that that rate as
published included the price of the commodity?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> We did it for business reasons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> I ask you for a categorical answer. Did
you or did you not intend to conceal from the Interstate
Commerce Commission the fact that that rate included the
price of the commodity?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> I decline to answer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In another part of the hearing, Mr. Field said to Mr.
Biddle: “Can you say, Mr. Biddle, how it happened that
you issued a circular to your subordinates in which you
said, with reference to these coal rates, ‘To be billed at
figures furnished by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company,
which include the freight rates and the price of coal; the
rates issued in the regular tariffs to be the minimum’?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Field.</span> Will you tell us?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> It is because the railroads—the Western
railroads particularly—I don’t know whether the Eastern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>roads do it or not—have been engaged in the reprehensible
occupation of serving as a collecting agency for the coal
companies, and those particular instructions were given so
that the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company could sell coal to
John Smith at a given place and charge him $1.25 and
somebody else $1.50 for that same coal.”<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c012'><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>When the document was presented in evidence before
the Interstate Commerce Commission, counsel for the railway
objected to its introduction on the ground that it had
been stolen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morawetz says that the rate agreement in respect
“to shipments to the El Paso and Southwestern was a
three-cornered arrangement made in New York in 1901
between the Colorado Fuel Company, the Santa Fe,
and Phelps, Dodge &amp; Co., who operated large copper
mines and controlled the El Paso and Southwestern
Railway.”<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c012'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Morton, who was then the head of the Santa Fe
traffic department, says that in 1901 the people interested
in smelting and mining in Southern Arizona and Northern
Mexico threatened to use Eastern coke or build a coal railroad
of their own unless lower prices were made on the
coal and coke they were receiving at El Paso and Deming.
They were large consumers, and their threat menaced a
traffic worth nearly a million dollars a year to the Atchison
system. To protect its interests the Santa Fe entered
into an agreement with the Fuel Company and the El Paso
and Southwestern people the terms of which were that the
Fuel Company was to supply coal at $1.15 a ton, and the
Santa Fe was to haul the coal to El Paso and Deming “at
the very low rate of $2.90 per ton, which was in reality a
division of rate, not usually published.” And “the Southwestern
people were to pay $4.05 for the coal which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>to be used by the railroad itself and the industries along its
line.”<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c012'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This arrangement was, in view of the rates charged shippers
from other points and other consignees at El Paso and
Deming, a clear violation of the common law and the Interstate
Commerce Act. A Federal injunction was served on
the Santa Fe in March, 1902, forbidding departure from the
published rates, and the Elkins Bill was passed in February,
1903. The El Paso arrangement was not at the start a
defiance of injunction or the law of 1903, but became such
by its continuance after their issue. General Traffic Manager
Biddle and General Freight Agent Gorman sent out
general orders in March, 1902, and February, 1903, that the
law was to be obeyed, and that “no departure therefrom
will be permitted so far as this company is concerned,”
but the law was not obeyed nevertheless. A general order
of a railroad manager counter to the financial interests
involved does not seem to count any more than a Federal
injunction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The El Paso agreement was by no means the only breach
of law in the case. Even the discriminations in respect to
shipments between New Mexico points were in direct violation
of settled principles of the common law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Commission found that the Santa Fe acted as agent
for the Colorado Fuel Company in collecting from its customers
the price of the coal itself along with the freight
rate;<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c012'><sup>[192]</sup></a> that for over five years (July, 1899, to Nov. 27, 1904)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>the railroad had paid the Colorado Fuel Company a rebate
of $1.10 to $1.25 per ton on shipments to Deming; that
the railroad and the Coal Company have “systematically
and continuously” violated the Interstate Commerce Act
of 1887 and also the Elkins Act of 1903; and that from
March 25, 1902, till Nov. 27, 1904 the railway had been in
“continuous disregard” of the order of the United States
Circuit Court (in a suit begun at the instance of the Interstate
Commission) enjoining the railway to observe its
published schedules of rates.<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c012'><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Commissioner Prouty says: “In all my experiences with
railway operations I never saw such barefaced disregard
of the law as the Santa Fe railroad and the Colorado Fuel
and Iron Company have manifested in this coal case. For
years the railroad company has received less than its published
rates from the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company
while its competitors have paid higher rates.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The counsel, Judson and Harmon, employed by the Government
to examine into the “alleged unlawful practices
of the Santa Fe in the transportation of coal and mine
supplies” reported to the Attorney General, February 28,
1905, as follows: “From August, 1902, until December,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>1904, the railway company continuously transported coal
for the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company at less than the
published rates then in force, from various points in Colorado
and elsewhere to El Paso, Tex., Deming, N. M., and
other places, to which such transportation was interstate
commerce.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This was done by secret arrangement between the two
companies, under which the coal was apparently billed at
the published rate of freight, although in fact the price of
the coal was included. The railroad company collected the
amount shown by the billing, and paid over part of it to
the fuel company as the price of the coal, making the real
charge for transportation less than the published rate by
just that amount. At the same time the rates given and
charged other shippers were the published tariff rates
without any deduction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This plan, and the way it was carried out, plainly
indicate an intention to deceive the Government and the
public, and to enable the fuel company to gain a monopoly
of the coal supply at the points involved by giving them a
strong advantage over competitors in the actual cost of
transportation. The motive for thus favoring the fuel
company does not appear in the evidence thus far taken,
but the fact is clear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This secret arrangement with the fuel company involved
the carriage of hundreds of cars per month. The
concessions from the established rates must have amounted
to about a million dollars for the two and one-half years
during which they were granted; and it is incredible that
this scheme was devised and carried out by any authority
but that of the chief officers of the railway company, who
were in control of its traffic department. And it was the
duty of each and all of these officers to see that the injunction
(of March, 1902) was obeyed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The special counsel recommended that “the Atchison
Company and all its principal officers and agents who had,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>during the period above named or any part thereof, power
and authority over traffic agreements and freight rates, be
arraigned for contempt of court.”</p>

<p class='c007'>President Roosevelt has directed that proceedings for
contempt be taken against the companies in the Colorado
Fuel Case and the International Harvester Case, but will
not proceed against individual officers personally in any
case until the department is in possession of “legal evidence
of wilful and deliberate violation” of law on their part.</p>

<p class='c007'>I went over the Santa Fe while these secret discriminations
were in full blast, and met President E. P. Ripley,
Vice-President Paul Morton, and other high officials, who
impressed me so favorably in our talks about rates, discriminations,
etc., that I wrote in my notebook: “I believe I
have found one honest railroad in America, honest at least
in intent, whatever deviations from principle the system
may force upon it.” Mr. Spearman evidently got a similar
impression, for he says: “The Santa Fe has eliminated
preferential rates entirely from its own traffic problems;
and this sturdy determination to put all shippers on a just
and equal footing, to maintain open and even rates, is the
keynote of President Ripley’s successful strategy.”<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c012'><sup>[194]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This is stronger than the impression I received, which
was that discriminations did exist and it was not thought
possible that they should cease to exist, so long as competition
continues, but that there was an earnest purpose to
eliminate them so far as possible. Notwithstanding the
Colorado Case and others mentioned hereafter I still think
that the present administration of the Santa Fe is on the
whole relatively very honest and very admirable.<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c012'><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>President Roosevelt was led to a similar conclusion by
the frank and manly stand taken by Paul Morton in his
testimony in the Dressed-meat Hearings, Jan. 7, 1902. In a
letter to Mr. Morton, June 12, 1905, the President says:
“At the time when you gave this testimony the Interstate
Commerce Law in the matter of rebates was practically a
dead letter. Every railroad man admitted privately that
he paid no heed whatever to it, and the Interstate Commerce
Commission had shown itself absolutely powerless to
secure this heed. When I took up the matter and endeavored
to enforce obedience to the law on the part of the
railroads in the question of rebates, I encountered violent
opposition from the great bulk of the railroad men and a
refusal by all of those to whom I spoke to testify in public
to the very state of affairs which they freely admitted to
me in private. You alone stated that you would do all in
your power to break up this system of giving rebates.” It
was this, the President says, that led him to invite Mr.
Morton to take a place in the Cabinet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The high character and ability of Mr. Morton and President
Ripley and the fact that the Santa Fe management
seems to represent high-water mark in railroad honesty,
gives great importance to the Santa Fe cases, and the attitude
of her leading officers towards the law, and the principle
of impartial treatment of shippers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Morton is reported to have said to a representative
of the Chicago <cite>Daily News</cite>, December 31, 1904: “What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Mr. Biddle did was exactly right, in my judgment, and if I
had been in his place I should have done the same thing.”
And President Ripley is stated to have said to a reporter
for the <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite>, “It was not rebating. It was simply
a figure agreed upon by private contract. Mr. Paul Morton
was cognizant of it, and though his name may not be
affixed to the order, he was the man from whom Mr. Biddle,
the freight traffic manager, got authority to haul coal for
the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company on the terms named.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you also know of it, Mr. Ripley?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, yes, as I know of all of our business. I consider
it absolutely legitimate, and will do it again to-morrow if I
like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Knowing that serious misrepresentations have appeared
in the papers,—for example, that Mr. Morton was a stockholder
in the Colorado Fuel Company, and recreant to
Atchison interests, which was untrue, as Mr. Morton had
sold his stock in the Fuel Company and all its auxiliaries
when he left its employ before entering the service of the
Atchison in 1895—knowing the frailty of newspaper reports
I wrote to President Ripley and Paul Morton asking
if it were true that they had said Mr. Biddle did right in
making the arrangement with the Colorado Fuel Company in
respect to the rates to Deming, etc. They replied as follows:</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—I did say to the Press that Mr. Biddle’s
action in making the rate was exactly right. The whole
trouble arose from a mistake in our tariff printing department
in confusing the actual rate charged with the amount
to be collected at destination. It was our custom, and that
of all the other fuel roads in Colorado, to collect at destination
the price of the coal as well as the freight rate. Inasmuch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>as the tariffs printed are a guide intended quite as much
for the information of our own agents as for the public, the
clerks included the price of coal in the tariff as a guide to
collecting agents, but it did not occur to them that the information
was liable to mislead the public, especially as it
was a well-known fact that no shipper except the Colorado
Fuel and Iron Company could possibly be interested. The
whole transaction was a perfectly innocent one so far as regards
any intent to injure any interests or to deceive the
public in any way, nor was any person injured by the transaction.
I think that all this will transpire and be recognized
by the court in the case now pending at Kansas City,
though, of course, I am not in position to anticipate a court
decision. The trouble with the whole matter was the fact
that Mr. Morton was a member of the Cabinet and that
certain portions of the Press made use of the incident for
the purpose of discrediting the Administration.</p>

<p class='c020'>The matter was unfortunate in so far as it may have constituted
a technical violation of the Interstate Commerce
Law and of the Injunction, but that is the worst that can
be said of it.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—Referring to your query relative to the
remarks alleged to have been made by me on December 31,
1904, to a reporter of the Chicago <cite>Daily News</cite>, I have
to say that although I do not now recall everything that
may have been said by me in conversations which were not
intended for publication, it is quite possible that I did
remark to some newspaper men that in my judgment Mr.
Biddle’s personal action in the case was entirely justifiable,
and exactly what I or any other railroad man would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>done under similar circumstances. The contract between
the Railroad Company and the Fuel Company was of itself
neither unlawful nor unbusinesslike. On the other hand,
it was perfectly defensible from a legal standpoint, as well
as being good business ethics.</p>

<p class='c020'>The fault lay with the Railroad Company’s tariff bureau,
which failed to properly publish the tariff, which should
have shown that the published rate of $4.05 per ton
included the price of the coal ($1.15 per ton). There was
no discrimination in favor of the Colorado Fuel and Iron
Company; in fact, discrimination was impossible, because
there was no other shipper of coal in that territory.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were, however, other mining companies in adjacent
territory, along the line of the Santa Fe in New
Mexico, and at Gallup there were competitors in the
same field. The same day that the Commission began
to investigate the Colorado Case complaint was made
about the rates from San Antonio, N. M. San Antonio lies
150 miles north of El Paso on the Santa Fe line from
Trinidad, which is 500 miles from El Paso. The rate paid
by the Fuel Company from Trinidad was $2.90 and the
rate from San Antonio had been $1.25. “Under this
adjustment of rates a coal operator at Carthage whose product
reached the iron of the Santa Fe at San Antonio had
been able to compete with the Colorado fields, and had
entered into a contract for furnishing the Mexican Central
Railway Company with its fuel. While that contract was
pending the Santa Fe advanced the freight rate from San
Antonio to El Paso from $1.25 to $1.50. By this action
the operator at San Antonio was forced to give up his contract
and go out of business.”<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c012'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It seems clear that even our best railroads, while unwilling
to countenance graft and desiring to avoid all criminal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>practices, see nothing immoral in granting whatever favors
or imposing whatever disadvantages may be deemed necessary
to forward the financial interests of the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Santa Fe is by no means the only railroad that has
been kicking over the traces since the Elkins Bill was
passed. Mr. Hendrickson, Secretary of the Associated
Merchants of Cumberland, Maryland, told the Senate
Committee that he came “to complain of coal discriminations.
We are charged 15 cents more a ton to tide water
for our coal than is charged other mines in more distant
regions (50 to 75 miles further from market on the same
road), and we have a large amount of bituminous coal that
cannot be developed at the 15 cents differential.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Dolliver.</span> Why do they make this differential
against you?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Hendrickson.</span> I can only state that the Baltimore
and Ohio officials, when they were petitioned, said
that other districts have poorer coal than ours, a compliment
we did not appreciate under these circumstances;
and they object to letting our coal reach market as cheaply
as these districts which they claim have poorer coal.
Nevertheless, it shuts our region out entirely. It is practically
a confiscation of our coal values, not our coal, but coal
values, and that amounts practically to the same thing.”<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c012'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The B. &amp; O. made certain charges when coal was
loaded by tipple and exacted more if it was loaded in any
other way. This is an unreasonable discrimination against
all who do not load by tipple.<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c012'><sup>[198]</sup></a> The Pere Marquette
Railway has been selling ice to the Armour Car-Line at $2
a ton while charging other shippers $8 to $12 per ton.<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c012'><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The absorption of switching charges in some cases and
not in others constitutes an easy method of discrimination.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>For example, at Cincinnati there is a large buyer of lumber
whose yard is on what is called “Hazen’s Switch.” To
get to this switch from the Louisville and Nashville Railroad,
cars must go over part of the tracks of the P. C. C.
and St. Louis Railway and the Cinn. L. &amp; N. Railway.
These roads charge the Louisville and Nashville $6.50 to
$9 a car for switching. On lumber originating at some
points the shipper has to pay these switching charges in
addition to the freight; while on lumber from other points
the Louisville railroad pays the switching charges and the
shipper is favored to that extent.<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c012'><sup>[200]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>In a recent St. Louis case it appears that the railroads were
paying 5 cents a hundred to transfer companies for carting
goods across the river from East St. Louis to the depots in
St. Louis. They paid the same amount to the Grant Chemical
Company for hauling their own goods across the river
and also to the make-believe transfer company of the Simmons
Hardware Company, the traffic manager of which
organized the company’s own teams into a little transfer
company on purpose to get 5 cents per hundred from the
railroads. Other shippers were refused the 5 cent teaming
allowance. The Interstate Commission held that the payments
to the Chemical Company and the burlesque Simmons
transfer company were unlawful rebates.<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c012'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Traffic within a State not subject to the Interstate Commerce
Act is carried at low rates for favored shippers.
Sometimes the shipper pays the full interstate rates in consideration
of receiving preferences on shipments within the
State to which the Interstate Act does not apply. Allowances
and advantages are accorded in handling and storing.
Commissions are paid, and goods are billed at less than
actual weight. And goods are shipped under false classification
or to a false name under the “straw man” system.
This system is thus described by Mr. Gallagher, representative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>of the Merchants’ Exchange of St. Louis: “Instead
of billing that stuff to the man I have sold it to I bill it to
a fictitious man, or straw man. On the bills he is the actual
shipper. I do not see him at all, don’t know anything
about him, but he bills the stuff to the man that I want it
to go to, my customer, and it will go through all right, and
by and by the straw man sends me a check for a rebate.
You cannot find him; at least, I have not been able to do
it. That was also described to me by a man who practices
it.”<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c012'><sup>[202]</sup></a> Some shippers are allowed to let carloads lie 15 days
without demurrage, while others have to pay for the car
service they get.<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c012'><sup>[203]</sup></a> In the West I found many instances of
this. In Butte, for example, one mining company does
not have to pay any demurrage, while other companies are
charged with demurrage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Railway purchasing agents are instructed to buy supplies
from parties who are large shippers, and these agents buy
at prices which afford such shippers all the benefits they
would get from a rebate on the freight rates.<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c012'><sup>[204]</sup></a> This is, in
fact, only another way of paying rebates. The allowance
of fictitious claims is still in vogue.<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c012'><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Abuse of the “rebilling privilege” or the “expense bill
system” is still in full bloom. Rebilling properly relates
to the reshipment of goods received in unbroken carload
lots, so as to make them complete a continuous trip at the
through rate from the point of origin to final destination.
But it appears from a case passed upon this year, 1905, by
the Supreme Court of Mississippi, that merchants in Vicksburg
receiving freight over the Vicksburg, Shreveport and
Pacific Railroad are allowed to use their “expense bills,”
showing the amount of freight received over that line, in a
way that enables them to get reduced rates. Within 90
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>days of the date of any expense bill the holder can ship out
over that road an equal quantity of freight not necessarily
the same he had received, but anything he chooses. By
this means the Vicksburg merchants can get grain by
barge and ship it out at 3½ cents, while the merchants of
Meridian have to pay 10 cents on similar shipments, and
the low rate was not available either for merchants in
Vicksburg who did not deal with the said specially favored
associated line having the through rate.<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c012'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In a still more recent investigation (July 1905) by the
Interstate Commission at Louisville, Ky., it appears that
on presentation of an expense bill for each car of grain
from St. Louis at any time within the preceding 90 days,
the Louisville dealer may ship an equal amount of grain
on to Atlanta at a rate 3 cents per hundred below the
tariff from Louisville to Atlanta. One day during the
hearing 67 expense bills were presented in evidence, some
of which had been altered and the rest duplicated and even
triplicated with the result of giving the guilty shippers an
unlawful advantage of 3 cents a hundred over their competitors
selling grain in the southeastern territory. Many
of these bills were admitted to be forgeries from beginning
to end, while others were altered by erasing the original
words and writing in others. For example, wheat was
sent as bricks by erasing the word “bricks” on an incoming
bill, writing in the word “wheat” and using the altered
bill to forward a car of wheat at the expense bill discount.
Every one of the bills in the bunch we are speaking of was
in favor of a single Louisville firm which does an immense
business in the Southeast.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other cases goods are not billed right. Dealers have
been known to ship cutlery as iron bolts, and dynamite as
dried apples. False billing as to weight is practised both
in freight and express shipments. The carrier acts in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>collusion with the shipper in some cases while at other
times the carrier is among the defrauded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes large amounts of freight are sent without
being billed at all. “I know of a point,” said Mr. Davies
of Chicago, representing 70 fruit associations of that city,
“where 150 cases of strawberries were systematically
loaded on a car upon which there was never any freight
paid, and the rate was 21½ cents a crate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Kean.</span> How long ago was that?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Davies.</span> A year or two ago. It is done to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Kean.</span> Do you have knowledge of it?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Davies.</span> Yes; and so can you, if you go around
the freight yards.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Kean.</span> Is this knowledge of yours a guilty
knowledge?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Davies.</span> I just a moment ago told you not, and
further, I will offer to this committee the records of my
business.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Kean.</span> But you say you know these
things are being done and have made no complaint.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Davies.</span> Haven’t I? I would like to show you
these papers that have been nursed by the Interstate
Commerce Commission for a year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Prouty of the Interstate Commerce Commission
says:<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c012'><sup>[207]</sup></a> “I knew some years ago that a train-load of wheat
was transported from Minneapolis to Chicago for nothing.
There was simply no record of that shipment on the books
of the railroad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Cullom.</span> What object had they in doing
that?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Prouty.</span> They wanted to prefer that man that
had the wheat. Instead of paying a rebate they carried
the shipment for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The power to give or withhold the milling-in-transit privilege
is a serious means of discrimination. The Pennsylvania
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Railroad, for example, grants this privilege to mills
west of Pittsburg, but denies it to millers at Harrisburg.<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c012'><sup>[208]</sup></a>
The Commission decided that the allowance of the privilege
of milling-in-transit by a carrier to shippers in one
section must be without wrongful prejudice to the rights
of shippers in another section served by its line. But
the evidence in this case was too meagre and incomplete to
enable the Commission to make any order in the premises
involving the general extension of milling-in-transit privileges
into a territory where such privileges had not been
previously allowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>By refusing to accord the milling-in-transit privilege<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c012'><sup>[209]</sup></a>
to some when it is granted to others the railroads may
crush a mill more effectively than it could be done by a
hail storm in which each hailstone weighed a ton. The
big Atlantic Flour Mill at Beach and Green Streets,
Philadelphia, was rendered useless by the Pennsylvania
Railroad’s refusal to extend to it the milling-in-transit
privileges enjoyed by other Philadelphia mills.<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c012'><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Western roads give saw-mills operating on their lines
and having logging roads an allowance of 2 to 4 cents per
hundred lbs. on the through rates. Roads east of the
Mississippi decline to make any such allowance, so that
the Western mills enjoy an advantage of 60 cents to $1.80
per 1000 feet in the through freight rates.<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c012'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“Midnight tariffs” or “flying tariffs,” changed while

wool and a yard wide, strictly gilt-edged and in accord
with the statutes made and provided for the publication
and observance of schedule rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a big shipper gets ready to send a large amount
of freight the railroads will suddenly make lower rates,
publish them just in time to fulfil the law, and the moment
the shipment is made the lower rates are withdrawn. For
example a miller contracted for 17,000 bags of flour. At
400 to the car, 17,000 bags will make quite a string of
freight. He went to the railroad folks and got a cut rate
of 5 cents a hundred on that amount. They slapped in
one of these “midnight tariffs,” published it, and gave
notice of withdrawal just as soon as the contract was
filled.<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c012'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

When he got ready to ship, the railroads reduced the tariff
2 cents per bushel, so that he could ship at a low rate.<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c012'><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>In some cases discriminations are the result of <em>intentional
mistakes</em> in printing rate schedules. A tariff is printed with
a 3, perhaps, in place of an 8, so that a rate of 38 appears
as 33, or a rate of 82 as 32. After a few copies have been
printed and sent to favored shippers the error is conveniently
discovered and the schedule is corrected for all
ordinary shippers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The payment of elevator or commission fees continues to
be a means of discrimination beyond the reach of the law
as it stands to-day. Some lines which have buyers on their
roads who own elevators at terminal points allow an elevator
charge or commission to their buyers, usually 1¼ cents
per hundred, which constitutes practically a rebate or preference
not accorded to other shippers. Other lines which
have no elevators pay a rebate to their buyers equal to the
elevator charge.<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c012'><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A judgment has been obtained for $5,600 damages in
favor of the Kellogg Elevator against the Western Elevator
Association and the four trunk lines—the New York
Central, the Erie, the Lackawanna, and the Lehigh—on
the ground of conspiracy to ruin the business of the Kellogg
Elevator by discrimination in freight rates in favor of
the elevators in the Combine. The charge was that the
railroads contracted to pay the elevator trust ½ cent per
bushel for all grain shipped on their rails from Buffalo,
whether it was elevated from lake vessels by the Elevator
Trust or not. So, in effect, the Elevator Trust was given a
rate of ½ cent per bushel cheaper than the Kelloggs could
get, and also that premium on the Kelloggs’ business. The
verdict of $5,600 was for three weeks’ operation of the conspiracy.
The Kelloggs claim that the annual damage to
them from discriminating rates amounts to $50,000 or
$75,000. The case is now pending on appeal to the Supreme
Court of New York.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>In the investigation now going on in Kansas City (July,
1905) it appears that some elevator men get double rebates,
while others get no allowances at all from certain roads.
E. O. Moffat said he got 1¼ cents a hundred from the
Union Pacific, Rock Island, Burlington, Santa Fe, Alton,
and Missouri Pacific, but got nothing from the Milwaukee.
That railway he believed paid an allowance to the
Simonds-Shields Company but refused to allow him anything,

<p class='c007'>M. H. McNeill, representing the Chicago and Great

the Simonds-Shields Company was asked by Commissioner
Cockrell: “When such allowances are made are not opportunities
for discrimination and the granting of rebates

<p class='c007'>“Certainly,” he replied.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Unfair discriminations in respect to special commodities
are very common. The New Haven and Hartford charges
$80 a car on peaches from New York to Boston, 228 miles,
while the same peaches come from Georgia points to New
York, 1150 miles, for $162 a car. The Commission says
the $80 rate is arbitrary and unjust and that $50 a car would
be a reasonable charge.<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c012'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad made its rate on
peaches depend on the valuation put on the fruit, in order
that by increase of rate in proportion to valuation, shippers
might be led to put low valuation on their shipments and
so provide the railways with an argument against paying
the real damages in case of accident or loss.<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c012'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>From some places shingles are carried at rates as low as
those applied to lumber, while shingle shippers at other
points pay more than the lumber rates. This is held an
unjust discrimination against shingles, and against the
places and shippers that pay the high rates.<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c012'><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Railroads make high rates on ties, higher than on lumber,
in order to prevent their shipment to other parts of the
country, and so diminish their value and lower their cost
to the discriminating railroad. The president of one railroad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>stated the policy clearly: “We are simply following
what we consider our interest, which is to prevent the shipment
of tie lumber.”<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c012'><sup>[220]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Early this year, 1905, the South Side Elevated road of
Chicago wanted 400 carloads of ties. The blanket rate on
ties from the entire yellow pine belt to Chicago is 26
cents per hundred lbs. On shipments originating between
Luzon, La., and Pearl, Miss., the Illinois Central made a
special tariff (March 22 and April 6, 1905), fixing the rate
on ties at 26 cents per tie, each tie to be billed at 130
lbs. This was equivalent to a reduction of the rate to
20 cents per hundred lbs., and no shipper outside of the
favored region could compete in the Chicago market. It
is suspected that the party who got the Elevated contract
knew beforehand that the railroad would issue this special
tariff, and was therefore able to underbid competitors in
perfect safety.<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c012'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A rate of 90 cents a ton is charged on coal for a special
use such as railroad supply, while the same coal must pay
$1.85 between the same points if intended for manufacturing
or other industrial domestic use.<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c012'><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is unjust discrimination to charge more for carrying
cattle and hogs than for carrying packing-house products,
and the desire of the carrier to get more business by so
doing is no excuse.<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c012'><sup>[223]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads have carried dressed meats from Omaha to
Chicago at 18½ cents, while charging 23½ cents on live-stock
from Iowa points nearer Chicago. The packer could buy
the cattle at Fort Dodge, Iowa, ship them to Omaha, kill
them and ship the dressed carcasses to Chicago, cheaper
than the live-stock owner at Fort Dodge could ship the
cattle to Chicago. Some years ago on arbitration, Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Fink and Judge Cooley being the arbitrators, it was decided
that the fair ratio between live-stock and dressed
meats from Chicago to New York would be 26 cents per
hundred for live cattle, and 45 cents for the dressed
carcass. But the railroads have reversed this relation,
although the Interstate Commerce Commission has decided
that the rate on dressed meats should be higher than on
live-stock.<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c012'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Recently, January 1905,<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c012'><sup>[225]</sup></a> the Commission has reaffirmed
its decision of 1890 and held that it is unlawful to charge
more for transporting live-stock from Missouri River points
and St. Paul to Chicago than for carrying packing-house
products between the same points, but the Beef Trust
cares nothing for the opinions of Judge Cooley nor for the
orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the
Trust controls the railroads.</p>

<p class='c007'>On shipments from Chicago east to New York the rates
are 28 cents per hundred and 45 cents on dressed beef.
Formerly the same rule applied in the West, but when the
Beef Trust began to build up great packing-houses at
Omaha, Kansas City, and St. Paul, they wanted to make
the rates on cattle from the West to Chicago higher than
the rates on beef, so as to force live-stock to come to their
stockyards on the Missouri River where they had a practically
absolute monopoly, and the railroads obeyed their
behest. Shippers fought the change, and in 1890 the Interstate
Commission ordered the railroads to desist from
charging more for live-stock products than for packing-house
products. The railroads did not dare to raise Armour’s
rate on dressed beef, so they reduced the live-stock
rate to 23½ cents, the same as the rate for dressed meats.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Armour then demanded and received a rebate of 5 to 8
cents a hundred lbs. on packing-house products. The
rebate was secret at first, but after the Elkins Bill was
passed the beef men made a contract with the Great
Western road at the rate of 18½ cents and the rate was
published. The cattle rate remained at 23½ cents so that
Armour and his railroad allies were again in open defiance
of the orders of the United States Government issued
through its Interstate Commerce Commission. The new
decision of the Commission, January, 1905, requiring the
railroads to charge more for live-stock than for live-stock
products has not been obeyed and is not likely to be.<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c012'><sup>[226]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“Could anything more clearly show the power of the
Trust,” says Mr. Baker, “than this reversal of the order of
rate-making as manifested in the tariffs east of Chicago, so
that beef, the high-priced product, is shipped at 18½ cents,
while cattle, the low-priced product, is shipped at 23½ cents,
simply to enable the Trust to close the Chicago market—the
best market in the country for export cattle—to thousands
of western cattle growers? They cannot afford to
ship live-stock to Chicago at 23½ cents when the Trust can
ship the products of the same cattle, weighing only 60 or
70 percent as much as the live animal, at 18½ cents. They
are therefore compelled to ship to Missouri River points
where the Beef Trust is in absolute control.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A rate of $1.25 per hundred lbs. on oranges from California
to points on and east of the Missouri River, while
lemons are carried for $1 to the same points—is held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>unreasonable.<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c012'><sup>[227]</sup></a> A higher charge on rye and barley than

<p class='c007'>Western millers complain that the discrimination between
flour and wheat on shipments to the East is causing them
much injury and will put them out of business. The Commission
decided that the difference should not exceed 2
cents a hundred, but it has no power to enforce its order
and “frequently for considerable periods there is very
great discrimination between the rates on flour and the
rates on wheat.”<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c012'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>DISCRIMINATION BY CLASSIFICATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The intricacies of classification afford boundless opportunity
for favoritism. Classification is always more or
less arbitrary by necessity, and is frequently more arbitrary
than necessary. One industry or wholesale trade is often
charged two or three times as much as another for the
same service. The New York Railroad Commission found
the railroads charging twice as much on dry goods as on
coffee or sugar and protested against the rule as utterly
indefensible, but the railroads refused to comply with the
request for a change. Iron and coal cost less to transport
than grain, yet the ton-mile rates on iron and coal from
Pittsburg have been at times for years together from 2 to
5 times the rates on grain from New York to Chicago.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1890 the Interstate Commerce Commission ordered the
railroads to transfer soap from the 5th to the 6th class. In
1900 the railroads changed it back to 5th class in carload lots,
and from 4th to 3d class in less-than-carload lots, but if
shipped in mixed lots with dressed beef it goes as 5th class.
So that Armour, Swift &amp; Co., of the Beef Trust, have been
able to ship soap in less-than-carload lots at much lower
rates than their competitors.<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c012'><sup>[231]</sup></a> The Commission ordered the
roads to cease their excessive discrimination on less than
carload lots, etc. The roads refused to obey. The Circuit
Court has sustained the order of the Commission.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Under the Illinois Central tariffs at one time it made a
difference of $40 a car if a man shipped a peck of potatoes
in a car of 16,000 lbs. of strawberries. If there were no
potatoes in the car so that it was not a mixed load, it cost
$40 more than if there were a peck of potatoes in with the
strawberries.<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c012'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The classification of castor oil on the Lake routes affords
a curious example of the freaks of tariff classing. Vegetable
castor oil is 5th class, or 16½ cents a hundred, from
Cleveland to Chicago, while mineral castor oil takes a rate
of 25 cents a hundred.<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c012'><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The law has not yet definitely touched the favoring of
large shippers by excessive difference in the rates on carloads
and less than carloads. There is not more than 5 percent
difference in the cost of transporting goods in carload
lots and less-than-carload lots, and yet the rates vary from
30 to 80 percent, as a rule, and sometimes 150 percent.<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c012'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In a famous case three years ago, involving the rates on
400 commodities from the Middle West to the Pacific Coast,
the Commission held that a differential between carloads
and less than carloads, which is at once more than 50 cents
per hundred and more than 50 percent of the carload rate,
is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> excessive, and puts the railroad on the defensive
to show special reason why so great a difference should
be made.<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c012'><sup>[235]</sup></a> The difference between the carload rates and
less-than-carload rates, involved in this complaint, was held
to be excessive in many cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the Yazoo and Mississippi Railroad and the Illinois
Central, 1 horse can go 667 miles for $36 and 4 horses pay
$99, while 25 horses can take the trip together for $100.
This encourages social habits. The first horse is billed at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>2,000 lbs. no matter what he really weighs; the second is
billed at 1,500 lbs.; and each additional animal counts
1,000 lbs. The rate is double first-class, or $1.80 per hundred,
which the Commission says is twice the fair rate.<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c012'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In a recent case it appeared that the Texas and Pacific
was charging 42½ cents per hundred lbs. on cattle from
Fort Worth to New Orleans, and $15 a car additional on a
shipment of less than ten carloads. This addition of $15
a car was held unreasonable.<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c012'><sup>[237]</sup></a> For 17 years the road made
a much lower rate—34 to 40 cents per hundred lbs., without
any $15 a car additional. In March, 1903, the rate
was raised to 42½ cents, and in October of the same year
the additional charge of $15 a car was imposed. The distance
is 500 miles. The distance from Fort Worth to
Kansas City is about the same, while to St. Louis it is
700 miles. The rate on cattle from Fort Worth to Kansas
City is 36½ cents, and to St. Louis 42½ cents, without any
$15 addition. The Commission held the $15 charge to
be an unjust discrimination between the large and small
shippers, and against New Orleans in favor of St. Louis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Discriminative rates are made oftentimes without any intent
to prefer one shipper to another, but simply to make
things move. For example, a business man of Greensboro,
N. C., wanted to build a smoke-stack of New Jersey brick,
but the rates from New Jersey were too high. “A quotation
was made me by the stack builder, whose office is
in New York, and I remarked to him, ‘That price is
prohibitive; I cannot pay that price for that stack.’ He
said, ‘That is the best I can do; but if you will tell me
what you can afford to pay for that stack in competition
with home-burned brick, I will see what I can do with the
railroad people.’ He wanted to know how soon it would
be necessary for him to give me a reply, and I said, ‘I
want to know within ten days.’ He said, ‘All right; I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>will take it up with the railroad people.’ His quotation
included the delivery of the brick and the erection of the
stack at my plant. It would require something like 50
carloads of brick to build that stack. Within a week he
had his price revised, and gave me a satisfactory quotation
and took my contract for the stack.”<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c012'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads, having regard to what the traffic would
bear, gave the builder a special rate in order that the
New Jersey brick might move over their lines to North
Carolina.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>VARIOUS OTHER METHODS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Railroads are in the habit of giving special rates on stuff
sent over their lines for other roads. “It is done,” says
one of the leading traffic managers of the country, “on
everything that is handled,—supplies, coal, and material.”<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c012'><sup>[239]</sup></a>
This enables any one who stands in with the management
of a railroad to have coal, etc., billed at low rates to the
railroad for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The routing of freight is the source of a double discrimination.
Connecting lines in some cases pay shippers
to route the goods over their roads, while in other cases
the connecting lines pay the rebates to the originating line,
or make an agreement with it for reciprocal favors in the
routing of freight.<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c012'><sup>[240]</sup></a> Shippers receiving rebates from a
connecting line can afford to pay the originating road or
its clerks to route the goods over the said connecting line.
Mr. Morawetz says it is customary for shippers to pay
clerks in the routing department $5 or $10 to route the
goods the way the shipper desires. Or it is done by giving
theatre parties or presents to wives and daughters.<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c012'><sup>[241]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>In the California Orange Routing Case (132 Fed. Rep.
829) the United States Circuit Court decided that an
agreement between railroads as to routing, whereby the
apportionment of freight to connecting roads is affected,
is in the nature of a traffic pool and comes within the prohibition
of pooling, Section 5, of the Interstate Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Interstate Commission held that the regulations of
the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe, reserving to themselves
the right of routing, were unlawful under the discrimination
clauses, but the court did not decide this point. (I. C. C.
Rep. 1904, p. 78.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Ferguson says the private car-lines “sell the tonnage
to the highest bidding connecting line. It is purely a matter
of bargain and sale.”<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c012'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Unfair distribution of cars is an easy means of discrimination.
Failure to furnish cars to complainant for shipments
of grain, while supplying more than a fair proportion
of cars to a competing shipper in the same town, is as
effective as any rebate could be.<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c012'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Railways have refused cars to persons desiring to ship
railroad ties which the railways did not wish to have go
out of their own field.<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c012'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A Michigan railroad neglected to furnish the Richmond
Elevator Company with cars in which to ship the hay the

was all the while supplying other shippers with cars for
hay and straw, etc.<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c012'><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Pennsylvania Railroad has been recently sued by
independent coal companies along its line for $2,000,000
damages for refusal to furnish cars in fair proportion. It
is charged that the mines in which the railroad company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>is interested have had all the cars they needed, while the
independents have not received cars enough to fill their
orders; in consequence of which great loss has been inflicted
upon them and their business diverted to the railway
mines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The B. &amp; O. was also sued for refusing to furnish cars
to the Glade Coal Company, while supplying cars to competing
mines.<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c012'><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of the West Virginia Northern Railroad<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c012'><sup>[247]</sup></a> the
Circuit Court issued a mandamus ordering the road to cease
from discrimination against the Kingwood Coal Company
in the supply of cars and to furnish said company with a
specified percentage of cars. In affirming this decision the
Circuit Court of Appeals said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is insisted that the court had no power in a proceeding
of this character to fix the percentage of cars the relator
should have, and to command that such percentage of cars
should be furnished to the relator. The acts of Congress
forbade discrimination and made it unlawful to give any
undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to particular
persons, companies, corporations, or localities, or any
particular description of traffic, or to subject them to any
undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect
whatsoever, and vested jurisdiction in the circuit and
district courts to proceed by mandamus as a cumulative
remedy for violations of the statutory provisions. We
are unable to accept the view that Congress intended to
confine the scope of the writ to admonition merely, or to a
general command to desist from discrimination, rather than
from the particular action in which the discrimination consisted.
By the findings, the delivery to the relator of any
less than 31 percent of the supply amounted to unlawful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>discrimination, and the judgment of the court did no more
than to correct it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes it is the denial of a switch, that blocks the
independent; for example, the railroads controlled by the
coal pool refused to put in a switch for the Johnson coal
mine or to permit the company to put one in until suit to
forfeit its charter for refusing equal opportunities to shippers
was begun in the Ohio Supreme Court. Then the
switch was put in.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Coal Combine and its railroads have persistently
pursued the policy of crushing smaller rivals by denying
them transportation facilities.</p>

<p class='c007'>An exasperating form of discrimination near of kin to
this refusal of cars is the refusal directly or indirectly to
take shipments for certain persons or to certain points.
The Hope Cotton Oil Company operates a mill at Hope,
Ark., for the manufacture of cotton-seed oil. It desired to
buy seed at various points on the Texas and Pacific Railroad.
This seed could only reach the mill by passing over
the Texas and Pacific to Texarkana and from there to
Hope by the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railroad.
The published rate from the points in question to
Texarkana was 12½ cents per hundred, and 5 cents from
Texarkana to Hope. After receiving this information the
agent of the Hope Company bought 49 carloads of seed on
the line of the Texas and Pacific, intending to send them to
Texarkana on the 12½ cent rate and from there to Hope
on the 5 cent rate. Seventeen cars were sent in this way.
But when the General Freight Agent of the Texas and
Pacific ascertained what was being done, he refused to
allow the shipments to continue, insisting that the seed
must take the broad joint rate of 67 cents applicable to
class A in which cotton seed belonged. Under his orders
the station agents on the Texas and Pacific refused to bill
the cars in any way to Texarkana on the published local
rate of 12½ cents. The 67 cent rate amounted to $13.40 a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>ton on seed which only cost $14 a ton, and to insist on
such a rate the Commission says “was for all practical
purposes to decline to receive the cotton seed for shipment
on any terms.”<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c012'><sup>[248]</sup></a> The secret of the situation was that the
Texas and Pacific did not want the cotton seed to go off of
its line. If shipped to Texarkana mills or other mills on
its line the products would find their way to market over
that road, while if manufactured at Hope this would not
probably be the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>Denying a private switch to one party while providing
such facility for a competing dealer<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c012'><sup>[249]</sup></a> may amount to a
preference similar to that resulting from free cartage.</p>

<p class='c007'>A discrimination in the place of delivery of freight may
work serious injury to a shipper. For example, D. W.
Miner, a dealer in beef and pork products at Providence,
complains to the Interstate Commerce Commission, July,
1905, that the New Haven road refuses to deliver his merchandise
at the Canal Street yard where his place of business
is located, carrying his freight half a mile beyond,
while delivery is made to his competitors at the Canal
Street yard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes railroads discriminate even on long hauls in
interstate traffic by taking advantage of the fact that the
Interstate Commerce Act does not apply to State traffic.
They take the car across the State line on a “mem.-bill,”
then draw a new bill of lading marked “State Business,”
and then pay the rebate without fear of disagreeable
consequences.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other cases the full freight is charged on the
way-bill, but a fictitious entry is made in the prepaid
column which is to be subtracted from the total amount
of charges when the bill is collected. If the freight on
a car amounted to $90, and $15 were entered in the prepaid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>column, $75 would be collected and the consignee
would be in the same position as if he had received a rebate
of $15 on the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another method, akin to this, is to give the local agent
at the station of delivery power to correct the way-bill, or
deduct a certain percentage from every bill presented to
the favored shipper. The agent forwards the amount collected
as full payment, correcting his accounts so as to give
himself the necessary credit, which is O. K.’d by the auditor
of the road on his next visit to the station.</p>

<p class='c007'>Large payments are made by some railroads “to encourage
new industries.” They have the example of cities
and States and of the nation to justify appropriations for the
establishment of infant industries and development of the
country, but they abuse the principle by making it a cover
for payments which are really rebates to favored shippers.
Some of the “new industries,” or infant undertakings,
which the Wisconsin investigators found were being “encouraged”
by cash contributions from the railroads, have
been established and prosperous for 25 or 30 years, one of
them being founded away back in 1873 and others in the
eighties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes the railroads make a low rate, joint or single,
on certain goods when intended for a specific purpose,
thereby limiting the low rate to certain favored shippers.
For example, in a recent case decided on complaint of the
Capital City Gas Company the railroads had made a joint
rate of 90 cents per ton on bituminous coal from Norwood,
N. Y., to Montpelier, Vt., when intended for railroad supply,
while the ordinary combination rate of $1.85 per ton applied
to such coal carried between the same points and
used for manufacturing or any other industrial or domestic
purpose. This was held by the Commission to be an unlawful
discrimination, on the ground that it is not permissible
under the Interstate Commerce Act for two or more
carriers to establish a joint through rate less than the sum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>of their locals, which shall be applicable only to a particular
shipper, or class of shippers, while denying such low rate to
other shippers of like traffic between the same points.<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c012'><sup>[250]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A method of discrimination that has spread enormously
in the last year is to pay large salaries or commissions to
traffic agents located at important points, on the understanding
that these traffic agents shall divide their salaries
or commissions with favored shippers. This is much safer
than paying rebates or commissions direct to the shipper,
and is one of the most difficult forms of discrimination to
overcome. In the recent investigations in Wisconsin and
other States this method has been found in frequent use,
along with underbilling and underweighing of freight, the
allowance of cartage or switching charges to favored shippers,
permission to hold cars as a means of storage for considerable
time without demurrage, midnight tariffs, direct
rebates, etc., etc.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <span class='large'>TERMINAL RAILROADS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Another method of preference without departing from
published rates is the division of rates with private terminal
companies or mere switching roads, or roads existing only
on paper. A man of large experience in railroad matters
said to me not two years ago that “Since injunction suits
were instituted by the Interstate Commerce Commission in
1900, published tariffs have been more generally followed.
But big concerns build a mile or more of railroad of their
own, or incorporate their switch tracks and sidings in a
railroad company, and the division of the through rate permits
any commission that may be desired. That is the new
kind of discrimination that is spreading very rapidly. The
effect is to concentrate discrimination and the advantages
it gives more and more in the hands of the largest concerns.
Formerly any big shipper could get a rebate. Now only
those big enough to build a railroad or own an elevator get
lower rates than others.” This is a little too strong. There
are many other forms of preference still in prevalent use,
as we have seen, but there is no doubt that the private
railroad and the private car do tend to concentrate discrimination,
giving greater and greater advantages to those who
need them least.</p>

<p class='c007'>They not only give the private railroads of some shippers
a larger percentage of through rates than they give to the
private railroads of other shippers, but they refuse to give
the railroads of some shippers any division of rates while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>dividing rates in this way with other shippers in the same
business.<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c012'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A few examples will make clear the private railroad or
“fake terminal” method of discrimination. The first case
of this kind came to light in 1903 through an investigation
of the “Salt Trust” by the Interstate Commission. Hutchinson
is the centre of the salt industry in Kansas. There
are 16 mills, 9 of which are operated by the Hutchinson
Salt Company, known as the “Salt Trust,” while each of
the independent mills is operated by a different individual
or company. In July, 1902, the Hutchinson and
Arkansas River Railroad was organized under the laws
of Kansas. It took possession of about 1 mile of side
tracks which had been built by the Salt Trust in connection
with its works. This new Lilliputian railroad company
had no equipment of any kind. The president of the Salt
Trust and the president of the railroad were one and the
same man, Joy Morton, brother of Paul Morton, who was
then at the head of the traffic department of the Santa Fe.
The Santa Fe, the Rock Island, and the Missouri Pacific—all
the railroads entering Hutchinson—made an agreement
with the switch-track Salt railroad to give said little 1–mile
Salt Trust railroad 25 percent of the rates on bulk salt to
Missouri River points, not to exceed, however, 50 cents a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>ton on all the bulk salt shipped to such points. The rate
to Omaha was 12 cents per hundred and the rate to Kansas
City was 10 cents. The division was therefore equivalent
to a rebate of 50 cents a ton, which is of itself an excellent
profit in the manufacture of salt. The result was that
without departing from published rates, or apparently violating
any provision of law, the trust and the railroads drove
the independents out of the bulk salt business on the Missouri
River and elsewhere, and an extension of the arrangement
to all markets and all kinds of salt would give the
Trust a weapon with which it could at any time destroy the
independents.<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c012'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Barton, one of the independents, had a contract to supply
all the bulk salt used by Swift &amp; Co., at Missouri River
points. The contract expired April 1, 1903. Before asking
renewal of the contract Barton went to the coal people
and the railroad to see what his costs were to be for the
coming year. He found that coal was to be advanced 25
cents a ton and freight on it 25 cents a ton, making 50
cents a ton more on coal. As it takes 1 ton of coal to produce
2 tons of salt, the increase in coal cost meant 25 cents
added to the cost of each ton of salt. Barton’s former contract
was on the basis of $2.25 at Hutchinson, now he must
have $2.50. While Barton was negotiating a renewal of
his contract with the Swifts, Hon. Frank Vincent, State
Senator, manager of the Salt Trust, and director in the
Salt Trust railroad at Hutchinson, took a vacation from the
legislature, went to see the Swifts, and offered them salt
on the basis of $2.10 at Hutchinson, or 40 cents less than
the independents could afford to sell it. The Trust got
the contract with Swift. This gives an idea of the extent
to which the railway favoritism enabled the Trust to underbid
the independents.</p>

<p class='c007'>The owner of one of the independent salt plants was
asked: “From where did you meet most competition, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>far as you know?” “From the Santa Fe Railroad,” he
replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most remarkable facts in the case is that the
division of rates with the Salt railroad was made without
even taking the trouble to find out whether or no there was
any railroad at all of any kind behind the name presented
in the request for a division.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Marchand.</span> Then you entered into this joint
arrangement with the Hutchinson and Arkansas River
Railroad without really knowing whether there was any
road there or not?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Biddle.</span> I have done that hundreds of times.”<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c012'><sup>[253]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Another indication that the terminal railroad is not the
real reason for the division of rates is found in the fact
that it is not every large shipper who can get a rebate by
owning a private railroad. One of the independent salt
mills, the Matthews mill, had a switch built and paid for
and expected to get a rebate of $1 a car on the strength of
it. But the railroad refused to give any division of rates.
Matthews did not belong to the Morton family, nor have
any other special claim to hospitality at the hands of the
Santa Fe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The International Harvester Company, popularly known
as the Harvester Trust, was formed in 1902 to consolidate
several big concerns manufacturing farm machinery. It
organized the “Illinois Northern Railroad Company” and
turned over to it the 17 miles of switching track in the
private grounds of its Chicago works. Till the end of
1903 this vest-pocket railroad handled the cars of the
Trust for a switching charge of $1 to $3.50 per car, the
average haul being about 4 miles. For the works at Plano,
another microscopic railway company, “The Chicago, West
Pullman and Southern Railroad,” with 4 miles of track,
was organized to switch the cars of the Harvester Trust.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>The International Harvester Company owns these two railroads.
Its officials are the officials of those railroads in
most instances. And it absolutely controls the operations
of the roads.<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c012'><sup>[254]</sup></a> In January, 1904, contracts were made for
the division of rates to the Missouri River. The Santa Fe,
C. B. &amp; Q., Rock Island, Chicago and Alton, Great Western,
Chicago and North Western, Wisconsin Central, Chicago,
Milwaukee and St. Paul, etc.—practically all the railroads
going west—allowed the private Trust railroads a division
of 20 percent of the through rate with the Missouri River
as a maximum, amounting to $12 on an ordinary car of
20,000 lbs. of farm machinery going from Chicago to any
point in Kansas or Nebraska or the Far West. The Interstate
Commerce Commission says: “Since the International
Harvester Company owns the Illinois Northern
Railroad, a payment to the railroad is a payment to its
owner, the International Harvester Company. When a
line transporting a carload of traffic from Chicago to the
Missouri River pays the Illinois Northern Railroad $12 for
switching that car from the McCormick works to its iron,
it gives the International Harvester Company a preference
of at least $8.50 over what any other shipper of that same
carload would be obliged to pay.... And there is no
limit in law to the extent to which this shipper may be
preferred to other shippers in this way.”<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c012'><sup>[255]</sup></a> In a suit
brought July 11, 1905, by R. B. Swift, a former officer of
the McCormick branch of the Harvester Trust, it is declared
that up to September 30, 1902, the Trust received rebates
from the railroads amounting to $500,000 through the
West Pullman switch road, and over $3,000,000 through
the Illinois Northern switch road.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>The “Chicago, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway” is
another of these homeopathic railroads. It was organized
in the interest of the Illinois Steel Company and is now
owned by the Steel Trust (The United States Steel Corporation)
which some time ago absorbed the Illinois Steel
Company. Since 1897 this private railway has been allowed
a division of 10 percent on business to New York and other
seaboard points, 15 percent to Pittsburg, Buffalo, and other
middle points, and 20 percent on traffic to the Missouri
River. It also has a division on rates to the South. All
Eastern and Southern lines as well as the Western roads
divide their rates with this Trust road. These divisions
amount to $6 to $12 a car for the switching service performed
by the private road. Besides this, certain special
divisions are made. On coke from the Connellsville region,
for example, a division of 70 cents per ton is allowed.
This gives the “Chicago, Lake Shore, etc.,” above named,
$700 to $1000 for hauling a train of coke 7 miles from
Indiana Harbor to its plant in South Chicago, while the
actual cost would not exceed one-tenth of this sum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Railroad officers have claimed that such divisions of rates
are justified because the little private road is the “gateway
of the traffic.” “The business originates on the little road
and it controls the routing, and the division is only an application
of the custom of allowing the road on which
traffic originates a considerable percentage of the through
rate, usually 25 percent.” Other railroad men tell me
that this is not true. President Tuttle, for example, says:
“There is no such thing as a custom to give the initiating
road 25 percent or 10 percent or any percent. The division
is on the mileage basis, but if one road does special
work, switching etc., a reasonable allowance may be made,
1 percent or 2 percent or whatever is fair to cover the special
work or expense.” Even if there were a custom to
give 25 percent to the initiating railroad that could hardly
explain the 70 cents per ton on traffic not originating on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>the trust railroad in Chicago, but coming to it from Pennsylvania
points.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever may be the custom or analogy used as a warrant
for these divisions it is clear that their effect is precisely
the same as that of a giant rebate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Trust railroad in this case makes a net profit of 150
percent a year upon its capital stock of $650,000. How
much the Steel Trust as a whole gets in this way through
all the private railroads connected with its various plants
is not known, but the Commission says it is certainly a
“sum sufficient to pay dividends on several millions of
dollars of capitalization.”<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c012'><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Illinois Glass Company at Alton, Ill., is the largest
producer of glass bottles in the United States. In 1895
certain persons in its interest organized the Illinois Terminal
Railroad Company, the principal business of which
is to handle the cars of freight that come to and from the
Glass Works. This terminal company in Alton is allowed
by the railroads a division of rates amounting to 25 percent
of the Chicago rate, and 15 percent of the rates to the Missouri
River and to Eastern destinations, or $8 to $13 per car.
This is the testimony of the Glass Works manager, but
the Commission finds that as much as $17.10 has been paid
the Terminal Company on a car shipped from Alton to
Kansas City, an amount that is nearly double the 15 percent
above mentioned. This $8 and $13 or $17 is a pretty
heavy payment for switching a car, a service which the Terminal
Company renders for $1.50 a car when the amount is
to be paid by the Glass Works.<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c012'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The St. Louis Preserving Company at Granite City,
Ill., also gets large rebates in the form of divisions of
rates with a toy railroad the company controls.<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c012'><sup>[258]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Rate divisions have also been made by the railroads with
boat lines<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c012'><sup>[259]</sup></a> belonging to or in league with large shippers,
with “tap roads” belonging to lumber companies,<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c012'><sup>[260]</sup></a> etc.,
and this method of securing a practical rebate is being
rapidly adopted by large concerns all over the country. A
division of rates with a private line is not necessarily unfair
but if there is a desire to give an unfair advantage, this
system affords a cloak for it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>PRIVATE-CAR ABUSES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Some of the worst discriminations now prevailing are
connected with the private-car system.</p>

<p class='c007'>The private car originated in the need for special
equipment for particular purposes. It was clear that
the transportation of live-stock, fruit, vegetables, and
other perishable products might be facilitated by the use
of special cars. When the inventors of improved stock
cars and refrigerator cars went to the railroad managers,
they were informed that the railroads had no money with
which to make experiments in such lines, but if cars that
would do the work proposed were constructed the railroads
would be glad to hire them for a fair rental. So the cars
were built by private companies and used by the railroads
on a mileage basis. The fact that such special cars are
needed in different parts of the country at different seasons,
their use in any large numbers being confined on some roads
to a few weeks in each year,<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c012'><sup>[261]</sup></a> makes the local ownership of
such cars by the several railroads, less convenient and economical
than their ownership by car companies able to distribute
the cars to advantage throughout the country so that
each section may have the cars it needs, at the proper time,
without unnecessary duplications of equipment.<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c012'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>To move the Georgia peach crop the Southern Railway
would need about 3,000 refrigerator cars. The shipments
occupy about six weeks, beginning about the middle of
June. The Pere Marquette Railroad moves about 2,000
carloads of fruit under refrigeration from Michigan
points mostly in September and October, and would need
about 1,000 cars for the work. These and other roads might
well hesitate to invest the sums required to provide expensive
equipment when it would have to be idle the greater
part of the year; but this is easily done by a car company
whose cars can be employed in the orange trade from California
and Florida in the winter, in the Georgia peach traffic
in June and July, and in the Michigan and New York fruit
business during the fall.<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c012'><sup>[263]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads began long ago<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c012'><sup>[264]</sup></a> and still continue paying
mileage rates for the use of stock cars, tank cars, and refrigerator
cars, the three chief kinds of private cars. This
would be all right if the mileage rate were fair, but serious
injustice results when the mileage is so great as to give the
owners of the cars a practical rebate of large amount on
all their shipments in such cars, as is the case with all
three classes of cars above named,<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c012'><sup>[265]</sup></a> and especially with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>refrigerator cars of the Armour Car-Lines which are operated
in the interest of the Beef Trust. The railroads allowed
at first a mileage rate of ¾ of a cent a mile when the car
was loaded. After a little the car companies got the roads
to pay the mileage on the cars both ways, loaded or empty.
The mileage rate on refrigerator cars was raised from ¾ of a
cent to 1 cent over most of the territory west of Chicago
and St. Louis, and the 1 cent rate also applies to the
movement of refrigerator cars between Chicago and New
England via Montreal.<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c012'><sup>[266]</sup></a> From Chicago to New York over
the Vanderbilt lines is about 1,000 miles; so the mileage
on a refrigerator car amounts to $7.50 each way, or $15
for the trip.</p>

<p class='c007'>The car companies have secured various concessions
from the railroads besides the payment of mileage loaded
or empty. They require the railroads to run their cars at
high speed in special trains. The average run of the
freight cars owned by the leading railroads is 25 miles a
day. The average run of the private tank cars (Standard
Oil mostly) is 66 miles, private stock cars 72 miles, refrigerator
cars 108 miles, and refrigerators operated in the
beef trade 135 miles per day.<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c012'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is evidence that Armour often makes his cars run
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>300 miles and even 400 miles a day. He compels the
railroads to push his cars day and night whether loaded or
empty. Most freight cars are loaded both going and coming,
which greatly lowers the cost of transportation, but
Armour requires the railroads to rush his cars back empty
at full speed without waiting for any return load. Ordinary
freight trains go on a side-track and wait till the
Armour cars go by. The railroads sometimes even side-track
passenger trains in order that a meat train may be
rushed by to make a little more profit for the Beef Trust.
Armour’s system of checking his cars by means of his agents
stationed at icing points along the principal roads keeps
his central office constantly informed of the whereabouts
of every car. If a train has lost time, if an Armour car is
side-tracked anywhere the Armour office asks over the
wires: “What’s the matter?” And if a railroad agent
does not do as Armour bids he may lose his position as a
consequence. More than one railroad man, high in authority,
has been dismissed because he did not obey the Beef
Trust. If offences accumulate, some day the railroad finds
that Armour has diverted his entire business to a rival line
which will hurry his cars and otherwise obey his orders.
What chance has the small shipper against such a system?
He may own private cars, but he cannot make them run,
nor can he obtain exclusive contracts such as Armour has
on many roads, nor make the railroads collect excessive
icing charges for him, nor hold up the roads in any other
way; on the contrary, they are more likely to hold him up.</p>

<p class='c007'>The result of high speed and the mileage rate loaded or
empty, is that refrigerator cars earn for their owners an
average of $25 a month, and cars engaged in the export
meat trade from Chicago frequently get $30 and upward
per month from the railroads in mileage. This is enough
to pay the whole cost of the refrigerator car in 3 years, and
its maintenance in the meantime.<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c012'><sup>[268]</sup></a> Private stock cars in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>some cases net their owners 50 percent a year on the
invested capital, repaying the cost of the cars in 2 years,
above operating expenses.<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c012'><sup>[269]</sup></a> The average mileage of through
stock trains on the principal lines exceeds 100 miles a day,
yielding to the owner of such cars over 60 cents a day.
This is three times what the railroads pay each other for
railroad cars in use on a road other than the owning railway.
A railroad receives 20 cents a day for each day that
one of its own freight cars is on another road, while the
same railroad pays the car companies 60 cents a day for
the use of a stock car, and $1 a day for the use of an
Armour refrigerator car in the dressed-beef business.<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c012'><sup>[270]</sup></a> Yet
a well built modern freight car costs more than the average
private stock car, and nearly as much, many of them quite
as much, as the average refrigerator car.<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c012'><sup>[271]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Out of a total of 50,000 refrigerator cars,<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c012'><sup>[272]</sup></a> about 15,000
are owned by the railroad lines. These earn, it is claimed,
about 40 cents a day, while the cars owned by the Armours
and other private car-lines earn or receive on the average
60 cents to $1 or more per day from the mileage payments
alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The owners of the Beef Trust cars make enormous shipments
of their own, and have gained control of a vast
amount of other business by offering a share of the mileage
receipts and other inducements to large shippers of fruit,
vegetables and dairy products, etc. With prodigious masses

any other refrigerators on the lines of the contracting

addition to the mileage on the cars loaded or empty.<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c012'><sup>[275]</sup></a>

railroads.<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c012'><sup>[276]</sup></a> Annual passes are also granted to owners of
private cars in order that their officers and agents may

<p class='c007'>One result of the exclusive contracts is that “charges
for refrigeration have been enormously and unreasonably
increased.”<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c012'><sup>[279]</sup></a> The Interstate Commerce Commission says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>that “under the operation of these exclusive contracts the
cost of icing to the shipper (some shippers) has been advanced
from 50 to 150 percent and that the charges in most
cases are utterly unreasonable.<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c012'><sup>[280]</sup></a> At first the railroads
made no charge for icing. Gradually the practice of making
small charges for ice was introduced, but the charges
did not go much if any beyond the cost of the service.
They were very mild compared to the present refrigeration
taxes. The charges made by the railroads and even by the
Armour Car-Line before it secured the exclusive contracts,
range from ½ to ⅙ of the present Armour icing charges.
From the Pacific to Duluth over the Northern Pacific or
the Great Northern, which still own and operate their own
refrigerator cars, the icing charge on a carload of fruit is
$25, while the Armour charge by the Southern lines is $107
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>per car. From Rochester to Cincinnati railroads using
their own refrigerator cars charge $5 for icing. For the
same distance and time the Trust charges $35. The icing
charge for a Pennsylvania car from Silver Creek, N. Y. to
Chicago, 500 miles, is $7.75 to $10; the Trust’s ice charge
is $25 from Lawton, Michigan, to Chicago, 120 miles. The
icing charge under the exclusive contract with the Armour
lines is $45 on a car of pineapples from Mobile to Cincinnati,
against $12.50 from New Orleans to Cincinnati over
the Illinois Central. In 1898 the Armour charge for ice
from Michigan to Boston was $20 per car. In 1904 its
charge was $55 a car for the same service over the same
route. The icing charge on an independent refrigerator
car from Chautauqua, N. Y., to Chicago, 550 miles, is $10,
against $84 in the Trust cars from Gibson to Chicago, 522
miles. In 1902, before the exclusive contract with the
Pere Marquette Railroad, the icing charge from Mattawan,
Mich., to Duluth was $7.50, while the present refrigerator
charge between the same points in the same Armour
cars is $45. On shipments of strawberries, etc., from the
South, the Armour icing charges are $45 a car, against $10
to $15 over roads that have not yet capitulated to the Beef
Combine. The Armour icing charge on strawberries from
Tennessee to Chicago is $84, against $30 on the Illinois
Central and $15 actual cost.<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c012'><sup>[281]</sup></a> From many points on the
Pere Marquette Railroad in Michigan to Chicago where the
railroad charge for refrigeration used to be $6 a car, the rate
under the Armour contract has been increased 416 percent.<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c012'><sup>[282]</sup></a>
In the Duluth case above mentioned the increase was 500
percent. This, however, is more than the average.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the great vegetable growing regions of Mississippi
and Alabama to Cincinnati the charge for ice was $27
before the exclusive contracts were made. Afterward the
price was raised to $60 and a little later to $75.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>In the summer of 1903 John Leverone of Cincinnati
received 24 cars of pineapples from Cuba. Ten cars came
by the Illinois Central via New Orleans with an icing charge
of $11.37 a car. Fourteen carloads came on Trust cars via
Mobile, 100 miles nearer Cincinnati, with icing charges of
$45 a car.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even when shipments are made in railroad refrigerators
from regions the Trust claims as its own peculiar territory,
the full Trust charges are collected and paid over to the
Trust.</p>

<p class='c007'>For example, in August, 1904, Coyne Bros. of Chicago
received an Illinois Central refrigerator car loaded with
melons from Poseyville, Indiana. The freight was $39 and
the icing charge $45. The Illinois Central icing charge for
that distance was $10. Coyne Bros. went to the manager
of the railroad refrigerator service and found that the road
had an arrangement by which the Trust was to be paid at
Trust rates on all shipments from the melon region, whatever
cars were used. If the firm refused to pay the charge
they would be boycotted or taken off the credit list.</p>

<p class='c007'>August 11, 1904, Coyne Bros. received a Louisville and
Nashville car loaded with melons from Epworth, Indiana.
On the bill were two charges for icing, one was the railroad
charge of $14 and the other the Trust charge of $45. The
firm asked if they were expected to pay both charges. The
railroad then erased the $14 item. The firm refused to pay
the $45 Trust charge for a service worth no more than the
railroad charge of $14, and the railroad took them off the
credit list. Mr. Urion, attorney for the Armour folks,
came to Coyne Bros. and told their manager that they must
pay the ice charges or else everything shipped to them must
be prepaid. The firm found that shipments to them from
the Michigan grape region were cut off. They sent their
own man to load the cars, but the railroad agent refused
to bill them. “I have my instructions from Armour’s man
here,” he said, “and I must follow them.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>On a car of melons from Carlisle, Ind., to Mr. Scales of
Chicago, the freight was $35 and the icing charge $50,
representing 20 tons of ice. There was no re-icing, and the
car bunkers would not hold more than 6 tons of ice, so that
there was a clear overcharge of $35 for refrigeration.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. D. Mead &amp; Co. of Boston were charged $99.90 by the
Armour lines for icing on a car of peaches from Missouri.
This is a startling sum for a service that the railroads used
to perform free of charge. On another car of peaches from
Maryland, the charge was $64 for icing. As the car bunkers
would not hold more than 4 to 6 tons and only one re-icing
was necessary between Cumberland and Boston, the
firm protested vigorously. They were told that the bill
was a “trial bill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is that?” they asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Try to collect,” said the railroad manager.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this case, on appeal to New York, the bill was reduced
to $24, a slice of $40 off the icing bill, which was to Mr.
Mead a <em>trial</em> bill in more senses than one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ellis and Company of Chicago received a car of tomatoes
from Gibson, Tenn., 522 miles away, and another from
New Orleans, 923 miles distant. The first was a Trust car
with $74 icing charge; the other was an Illinois Central
car with $15 icing charge. That is, the Trust charge was
5 times as great as the railroad charge, though the railroad
car came 400 miles further, nearly double the distance in
fact that the Trust car covered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grapes have been shipped from the New York grape
field to Boston in Vanderbilt refrigerator cars without any
icing charge, while shipments in Trust cars between the
same points in the same month paid $22 for ice. The
Michigan Central has given notice that it has withdrawn
from the Armour contract and will handle Michigan fruit
products in its own cars supplying ice at cost which it says
is $2.50 per ton. So the man who can ship over the
Michigan Central will get a rate of $15 to $25 a car to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Boston, while the man who has to use the Pere Marquette
will pay $45 a car for ice.<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c012'><sup>[283]</sup></a> Two Boston men recently
(1905) had occasion to order each a carload of peaches
from Michigan points some 20 miles apart. One car came
from Coloma over the Pere Marquette with Armour
charges of $45, while the other car came from Eau Claire
over the Michigan Central with the same freight rate, but
only $13.13 for icing,—$5.63 for the original icing, $5
for re-icing at Collingwood, and $2.50 for re-icing at West
Seneca. A year ago, before the Armour contract with the
Michigan Central expired, the icing charge on both railroads
was $55 to Boston; now the Armour charge has
come down to $45, but the Armour charge for ice in the
case just stated was $9 a ton while the Vanderbilt railroads
charged only $2.50 a ton, which last the Interstate Commission
in a recent case has held to be a just and reasonable
charge.<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c012'><sup>[284]</sup></a> There are no icing charges on dairy products.
The ice is paid for by the car company and the railroad.
It takes as much ice for dairy products as for fruit, but the
Trust is carrying its own goods in this field mostly and
not the goods of other shippers, and so it has not felt the
need of changing the original arrangement in respect to
ice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads have also bound themselves by secret contract
to furnish by wire “such information as may be
requested by the car-line’s representatives.” This enables
the Trust to know what every other shipper is doing all
over the country on the lines of the car-line-contract roads.
The Armours thus have means of knowing immediately of
the shipments made by competitors and the destination of
the same, so that they can tell exactly what to do to capture
or destroy the competitive business. If a car of
apples is loaded by a competitor and billed for Worcester,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the Trust knows of it in time to run in a car of apples
ahead of the competitor’s and sell out the market from
under him. At Buffalo, while the Trust was fighting to
control the local fruit market, it forestalled, they say, every
shipment that was made to its competitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Armour lines have another advantage, through the
arrangement of the freight tariffs, and the friendly inspection
methods, or non-inspection methods, which enable
them to ship dairy products, fruits, vegetables, etc., at
much lower rates than others. Packing-house products,
<em>i. e.</em>, hams, bacon, lard, etc., go from Chicago to New York
in carloads at 30 cents a hundred; fresh meats, 45 cents;
eggs, 65 cents; poultry, 75 cents; butter, 75 cents, etc.
The Armours have a practical monopoly on packing-house
products and the fresh-meat business, as they own all the
slaughter houses of any importance, with 2 or 3 exceptions
in the country. So the bulk of their own goods go at 30
and 45 cents which are regarded by railroad men as very
low rates for goods transported in refrigerator cars. On
the other hand rates upon dairy products are very much
higher, and most shippers have to pay those rates. According
to all rules of classification packing-house products
should pay higher rates than fruit; but, in order to help
out the infant beef industry, a commodity tariff is arranged
of which this is a sample:<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c012'><sup>[285]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>President Ripley of the Santa Fe declares that the rates
on beef products between Kansas City and Chicago are so
low that every carload is carried at a loss to the roads.
Here are his figures:</p>

<p class='c007'>Dressed meats: Actual cost per car, $82.19; revenue,
$42.19; deficit, per car, $40.</p>

<p class='c007'>Packing-house products: Cost per car, $85.03; revenue,
$56; deficit, $29.03.</p>

<p class='c007'>He also asserts that cattle are now hauled at a loss.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other witnesses have disputed President Ripley’s statement
of cost, but however this may be it is evident that
the Beef Trust has been very generous to itself in the rates
it has compelled the railroads to adopt for its shipments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads do not like to be bossed either by the Beef
Trust or the Standard Oil, but they declare that they
cannot help themselves. President Ripley says: “The
packing-house business to-day is concentrated in so few
hands that this fact, together with the competition between
the railroads, practically makes it possible for the latter
to dictate rates for dressed beef and the packing-house
products.”</p>

<p class='c007'>President Stickney of the Great Western Railroad says:
“In fixing the rate on dressed meat we don’t have very
much to say. The packer generally makes the rate. He
comes to you and asks how much you charge for a certain
shipment of dressed meats. The published tariff may be
23 cents a hundred, but he will not pay that. You say to
him: ‘I’ll carry your meat for 18 cents.’ He says: ‘Oh, no,
you won’t. I won’t pay that.’ Then you say: ‘Well, what
will you pay for it?’ He then replies, ‘I can get it hauled
for 16 cents.’ So you haul it for 16 cents a hundred.”</p>

<p class='c007'>President Calloway, speaking to the Interstate Commission
about the speeding of the beef cars and other Armour
exactions, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We do not do these foolish things from choice. I will
say that the thing is just as bad and foolish and stupid as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>can be, but what are you going to do about it? We have
built up these dressed-beef men and they have all got their
own cars, and they can dictate what they are going to pay.
They just keep these cars humping. We unload them and
get them back to Chicago just as quickly as we can. The
Pennsylvania people also were very much disinclined to
allow or foster this dressed-beef business, but were forced
into it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Very few railroads have dared to fight either Armour or
Rockefeller openly, but secretly the railroads did combine
to fight these men and employed an agent, Mr. Midgley
of Chicago, for that purpose, whose investigations and disclosures
have done much to throw light upon the hidden
ways of the Trust magnates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Midgley told the Interstate Commission in April,
1904, how the representatives of sixty railroads met in
St. Louis in 1894 and tried to stand up against the Trusts,
beginning with a reduction of the extortionate mileage
rates on tank and refrigerator cars, but they could not free
themselves from the yoke of oil and beef. The Standard
gave all its shipments to the Great Western, which agreed
to pay the old mileage. The other lines out of Chicago
could not get a carload to St. Paul or the Missouri River.
The railroads surrendered finally to both the Standard Oil
and the Beef Trust. They reduced the mileage rates on
stock cars, railroad cars, and other cars not controlled by
the Trusts to 6 mills per mile, but excepted refrigerator
and tank cars out of respect to the power of Armour and
Rockefeller, because, the trunk lines said, referring to the
power of these Trusts: “We have never been able to stand
up against it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have not yet finished with the favors shown to Armour.
The railroads as a rule inspect the loading of every
car and the unfavored shipper cannot mix eggs or poultry
with low-class provisions and bill it all at a low rate. But
the Armours can do this, for inspection in their case is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>mere form. There is one inspector for shipments that
average 75 cars a day. The inspector could not watch
them all if he would, and in fact he simply inspects the
Armour records and takes their word for the contents of
the cars.<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c012'><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is charged that Armour not only gets large quantities
of high-class freight carried at the rates appropriate to
lower-class freight by unreported mixing of his goods in
carload lots billed at the lowest rate applicable to any of
the goods in the car; it is also further charged that the
space beneath the beef that is hung up in the refrigerator
cars is often crowded full of poultry, eggs, etc., which are
carried for nothing. No wonder Armour can undersell his
rivals all over the country and ruin his competitors in any
market he chooses to enter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Beef Trust has compelled the railroads to fix a very
low minimum carload limit—20,000 lbs. on dressed beef,
etc., against 26,000 to 30,000 lbs. on products the big
Trusts are not interested in. If a load is below the carload
limit it has to pay less-than-carload rates, which are
20 percent or more higher than carload rates. It is for the
interest of the railroads to keep the minimum carload limit
at a good height to prevent hauling cars with small loads
and low rates, and to reduce the effect of the prevalent
custom of billing Trust cars at the minimum no matter how
heavily they are really loaded. The railroads have made
efforts to unite on a higher carload limit, but without avail
so far. On Dec. 12, 1903, it is said, 16 presidents and managers
of the greatest railroads in America met in New York
and decided to make 24,000 lbs. the minimum on dressed
meats. The proceedings were under promise of secrecy by
all concerned. But within two days the Trust people knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>all about the secret meeting, and they took measures which
prevented the new order from ever taking effect. No
agreement has ever been formulated that will stand against
the power of the Trust, the seductiveness of its promises of
diverting new masses of business to the yielding road, and
the terror of its threats of withdrawal of traffic from the
unyielding.</p>

<p class='c007'>These advantages—excessive mileage rates, high speed,
exclusive contracts, exorbitant icing charges, espionage of
competitors, control of tariffs, low carload limit, and go-as-you-please
inspection—have the same effect as a very large
rebate; the private-car owners can ship at very much lower
cost than ordinary unprivileged shippers. The profits are
immense—$72,000 a day, it is said for the Armour cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is estimated that the railroads pay the Beef Trust’s
car-lines about $25,000,000 a year in rebates or payments
in practical violation of the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the basis of the very moderate Beef Trust Report
of the Department of Commerce, Mr. Baker figures the
annual profits on the 14,000 Armour refrigerator cars, from
rentals alone, at $200 net per car, or $2,800,000—nearly
$3,000,000 a year, not including the enormous sums extorted
in excessive icing charges, nor the rebates and commissions
paid by the railroads in addition to the mileage. The estimate
of $200 a car is probably too low, for Mr. Robbins,
manager of the Armour Car-Lines, has testified that they
rent old, inferior cars to breweries, etc., at $204 to $280
per year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Baker says: “Can any simple-minded person see
any difference between a payment of $3,000,000 net profit
on mileage annually to a favored shipper like Armour, and
an old-fashioned cash rebate of $3,000,000? I confess I
cannot.”<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c012'><sup>[287]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Baker has deducted operating expenses, repairs, and
a liberal allowance for depreciation, but he has not allowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>for fair interest upon the capital invested in the cars, a
charge amounting to $650,000 a year which should be deducted
from the $2,800,000 in order to get the portion of
the mileage payment which is really equivalent to “an old-fashioned
cash rebate,”—an article that is not so old-fashioned,
however, as to be out of use, by any means, as we
have seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wherever it serves their purposes the car-lines share their
rebates with important shippers. This has been of special
service in inducing large shippers like the fruit growers of
California and the South to give their trade to the profit-sharing
car-lines. The car-lines would pay shippers a bonus
on condition that such shippers would call on the railroad
for the cars of the agreeing car-line. Both refrigerator
lines and stock car-lines use this method. Sometimes half
the mileage is paid to the favored shipper. Sometimes
$10 or $15 or even $25 and $35 a car is paid back to the
shipper by the car-line, which is of course a rebate pure and
simple, and has precisely the same effect when paid by
the car-line as if paid by the railroad directly to the
shipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Santa Fe car-line found it necessary to give a rebate
of $25 a car in California in order to get traffic in competition
with the Armour Car-Lines and on shipments going
beyond Chicago the rebate that seemed necessary to get
business was $35 a car. So Mr. Leeds, the manager of the
Santa Fe car-line testified in April 1904 before the Interstate
Commerce Commission. Part of Mr. Leed’s testimony
in answer to the questions of the Commission and
of its counsel Mr. Marchand was as follows:<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c012'><sup>[288]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Watson appears to have received on California
shipments about $50,000 a year in rebates from the Fruit
Growers’ Express (now an Armour line), and perhaps the
amount was nearer $100,000.<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c012'><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The reduction of icing charges to favored shippers is, of
course, only another way of paying rebates. Yet the car-lines contend that icing charges are compensation for a
private service which is not part of the transportation
service, and therefore outside the Interstate law. The
Interstate Commerce Commission says: “It has been very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>customary in the past, and the practice still prevails in
some quarters, to allow to particular shippers a reduction
in these refrigerator charges. Testimony recently taken
at Chicago shows that one large shipper of California to
various eastern destinations was allowed concessions of this
kind, which probably aggregated in a series of seven or
eight years several hundred thousand dollars.”<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c012'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The testimony of H. J. Streychmans before the Commission
at Chicago, May 12, 1905, throws much light on the
Armour Car business. Mr. Streychmans was for over 4
years, from April, 1900, to August 1904, in the employ of
Armour &amp; Company, and the Fruit Growers’ Express, one
of their car-line systems. One of his duties was to check
ice bills. He says the Armour Car-Lines generally pay $2
to $2.50 a ton for ice, except on the St. Paul and Northwestern
and Erie. On the Northwestern the Armours
paid $1 a ton for ice, and on the Erie $1.25 or $1.50.
“These were the main lines. The Northwestern and St.
Paul handled practically all the green fruit shipments, and
the Erie used to get the shipments east.” The profits
were “five or six hundred percent.” On the very long
hauls the percentage was not so high. From Fresno, California,
to Boston, for example, the cost of icing was about
$38 and the Armour tariff charge for icing was $125, leaving
a margin of $87 a car.</p>

<p class='c007'>On some roads Streychmans says that rebates were paid
the Armours on ice. The Chicago, Milwaukee and St.
Paul, for example, billed the ice at $2.50, but in paying
the railroad for the ice the Armours put in a rebate claim
for $1 a ton, reducing the net cost to $1.50. On the Texas
and Pacific, the company furnishing the ice remitted $1 per
ton making the net price $2.50. Ice cold rebates were also
paid at Buffalo.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Armours in their turn made “allowances” to favored
shippers. Streychmans had to make up “allowance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>statements” “showing the number of cars shipped by the
shippers and giving him a rate of 60 percent of the tariff
rate.” A “rebate of $15 to $25 a car” was paid back. The
last statement Mr. Streychmans put in typewriting before
leaving the Armour service in California was for a rebate
of 45 percent to Alden Anderson, Lieutenant-Governor of
California. The witness saw on the office file statements
of rebates to the Southern California Fruit Exchange of
$10 a car on 1904 shipments of oranges, etc. A number
of shippers in California got rebates amounting to 45 to
50 percent of the icing charges. They paid the actual cost
of icing plus a bonus of $10 to Chicago, $15 to New York,
and $20 to Boston. The cost and bonus together were
ordinarily less than half the tariff charges. For instance,
the Armour ice tariff to Boston from Southern California
was $120, the cost $38, and the bonus $20,—$58 total,
or a little less than half the tariff. The full tariff rates
were collected and the difference paid back. Shippers not
in on the secret-rebate arrangement paid the full rates and
got no discount.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Portland, Ore., to Chicago the Armour icing charge
was $45, because the Northern Pacific cars are there to
compete; but further south, at Medford, Ore., where there
is only the Southern Pacific, in league with the Armours,
the icing charge to Chicago is $75.</p>

<p class='c007'>When possible the car-line runs the cars without ice,
sometimes for long distances, but charges the shippers for
icing just as if it had been done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the railroads pay a bonus for the Armour business,
the St. Paul, the Northwestern, and the Grand Trunk,
for example; in other words, the Armour lines not only
charge extortionate rates for icing and get a mileage
on their cars loaded or empty, but in some cases sell
their tonnage to the railroads. In California, however,
the witness believes there is a traffic commission
to settle questions of the division of traffic between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Santa Fe cars and the Armour cars on the Southern
Pacific.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Streychmans as a confidential clerk was supplied
with a secret code for use in his correspondence. The
inside title-page says: “Transportation Department, General
Offices, 205 La Salle Street, Chicago, Ill. Cipher

<p class='c007'>It is evident that the Armour Car-Lines make a business
of arranging secret rebates, evading the law and
eluding the Interstate Commission.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are some 300 private car-lines in the country owning
and operating about 130,000 private cars. But the
law of concentration is acting on the private cars as well as
on the railways, and the private cars are rapidly consolidating
in few hands. Speaking of this movement in the refrigerator
business, the Interstate Commission says in its Report
for 1904, p. 14: “Some years ago there were a number of
these private-car companies which provided refrigerator
cars for the transportation of fruit under refrigeration.
Some of these were the Fruit Growers’ Express, the Kansas
City Fruit Express, the Continental Fruit Express, and
the Armour Refrigerator lines. These companies were all
independent of one another originally, and their cars were
used in competition with each other.... At the present
day all the above car companies have been absorbed by the
Armour Car-Lines Company, which has to-day, in our
opinion, a practical monopoly of the movement of fruit in
large quantities in most sections of the country. There is
the American Transit Refrigerator Company, which operates
over the Gould lines, and the Santa Fe Fruit Express,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>which operates over the Santa Fe System, and there are
numerous refrigerator lines, having a small number of cars
and engaged in a particular service, but we know of no
company other than the Armour Car-Lines which could
move the peach crop of Georgia or the fruits of Michigan.
And this company, having acquired sufficient strength to
do so, has adopted the rule that it will not allow its cars to
go on the line of any railroad for the purpose of moving
fruit from points of origin on that railroad, unless it be
under what is known as an exclusive contract.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By force of the enormous shipments the Armours control
they have compelled railroad after railroad to make the
exclusive contracts they desire, fix rates at their dictation,
collect exorbitant icing charges, give them an excessive
mileage allowance, return their cars empty if they will at
high speed instead of detaining them for loading back, etc.
And “if any railroad dares to disobey their orders when
they impose a requirement it will not get any more of their
traffic. The boycott cannot be visited more effectively
upon the railways. That is the secret of the whole situation.
They are the largest shippers, the most arbitrary,
the most remorseless that have ever been known.”<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c012'><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Is it any wonder that Mr. E. M. Ferguson, representing
a dozen associations of fruit and grocery and produce
houses, should tell the Senate Committee that the “situation
is tantamount to commercial slavery”? “It must be
plain to all that commercial freedom in any line of industry
has ceased when a gigantic trust like the Armour interests
are permitted, through ownership and operation of private
car-lines to absolutely control the common highways in so
far as the use of such highways may be required in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>transportation of that particular kind of traffic for which
their cars are a necessary instrumentality of carriage, thus
enabling the Armour interests (who, it will be remembered,
are also merchants in the commodities transported in their
cars) to completely dominate over all independent dealers
to the extent of fixing rates, conditions, and terms under
which such independent dealers may use the common
highways.”<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c012'><sup>[293]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The fate of a man left to the mercy of the Armours and
the mild influence of the Sermon on the Mount is similar
to the fate of a man without a gun encountering a tiger in
the jungles of Africa. Even the Government seems to be
unable to compel justice in this case. The big guns of the
Federal courts have little or no effect on the packers and
the railroads they have benevolently assimilated. They
disobey injunctions as freely as they do the principles of
Christianity and the dictates of conscience, with the excuse
perhaps, as to the last, of lack of acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Standard Oil still practically controls the railroads for
the most part so far as the transportation of oil is concerned,
manipulating rates and service so as to favor
its own business and hinder or destroy the business of
competitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the recent examination of Standard Oil methods by
the State of Missouri, L. C. Lohman, for 30 years an oil
dealer at Jefferson City, testified that he had been forced
to abandon his dealings with independent oil companies
because the Missouri Pacific and Missouri, Kansas, and
Texas roads refused to accept oil for shipment to him
from these companies.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>The railroads discriminate against the Texas oil wells
by making the rates on north-bound oil considerably
higher than on south-bound oil. Again the rate to various
points from Lima, the centre of the Ohio and Indiana
oil fields, is considerably higher than from Chicago, the
Standard Oil shipping point. For example:</p>

<p class='c025'>It costs 3½ cents more per hundred to ship from Lima, 470
miles, than from Chicago, 643 miles; 9½ cents more from
Lima, 916 miles, to Mobile, than from Chicago, 926 miles,
to the same place. The shorter distance has the higher
rate till you get 50 percent off, then the half distance from
Lima has about the same rate as the 100 percent distance
from Chicago.</p>

<p class='c007'>The average rate on 25 staple commodities is about 2
cents higher per hundred from Cleveland to New Orleans
than from Chicago to New Orleans, while the rate on
petroleum is 8 cents higher. This is a strong discrimination
against the Cleveland refineries in favor of the
Chicago shipping point at Whiting. The Standard Oil
is the only shipper of oil from Whiting.<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c012'><sup>[294]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The methods by which the Standard controls New
England are still in full swing. The report of the Industrial
Commission tells how the Standard Oil railroads
keep the independent refineries at Cleveland out of New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>England through high rates on oil by rail, while the
Standard ships by water, and by making oil second class
unless the shipper has a private siding or tank opposite the
rails of the New Haven and Hartford Railroad, but fifth
class if the shipper has such siding or tank, <em>i. e.</em>, if the
shipper is the Standard Oil Co.<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c012'><sup>[295]</sup></a> “The freight rate from
Cleveland to Boston,” says the report, “was formerly 22
cents per hundred pounds alike on iron articles, grain, and
petroleum. But since the Interstate Commerce Act the
rates have been changed, so that the rate on grain is
15 cents per hundred pounds, on iron 20 cents, and on
petroleum 24 cents. Again, on almost every commodity
through rates are made from Cleveland and other western
points to points reached by the New York, New Haven
and Hartford Railroad. On petroleum there are no
through rates, but a local rate is added to the Boston
rate. Moreover the New York, New Haven and Hartford
prescribes that petroleum and its products shall be in the
second class of freight unless the person to whom it is
shipped has a private siding or tank opposite the rails, in
which case it is fifth class, the rate for fifth class being
probably one-half that for second class. These arrangements
are explainable by the fact that the Standard
Oil Company ships oil from its seaboard refineries to
Boston largely by tank steamers, and distributes it from
there for a comparatively short distance at the local
rates.”<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c012'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the West the Standard has persuaded the railroads
to lift the rates on oil so high as to make competition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>difficult. The rate from Pennsylvania points to Chicago
was raised from 17½ cents to 19½ cents, and the rate from
Chicago to St. Paul went up from 10 cents to 20 cents.<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c012'><sup>[297]</sup></a>
The Standard pumps oil to Chicago by pipe, and the higher
the rates by rail the more impossible it is for the independents
to compete. Of course it is against the direct interests
of the railway stockholders to have rates so high as to
check the traffic in oil by rail, but the Standard does not
care about that, and it is a small matter even to the railroad
managers compared to incurring the displeasure of
Standard Oil, which has sufficient control in the railway
world to cause any disobedient railroad most serious loss
and even make a railroad war upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the Standard found other methods of controlling
transportation and milking the public it used to receive
half a million dollars a month in rebates. But some
railroad men who are in a position to know say that
since 1900 the Standard Oil has not asked for rebates,
the reason being that the tariffs are made in such a way
as to give the Trust all the advantage it requires.<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c012'><sup>[298]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The fight now going on in Kansas between the people
and the Oil Combine has forcibly illustrated the methods
of the Standard. When the Kansas oil fields began to
show signs of large prosperity the Standard went into the
State, put up refineries and storage tanks, laid pipe lines,
and began to build a through pipe line from Kansas to its
Chicago station at Whiting. By getting the railroads to
raise their rates on oil, compelling producers to agree to
sell their oil only to the Combine, resorting to cut-throat
competition to drive them out of any market they attempted
to enter, they practically captured the oil business of the
State and were able to put the price of crude oil down and
squeeze the independents until many of them were ready
to sell out to the Combine at the victor’s own price.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>The power of the Trust over the railroads is illustrated
by the case of Mr. I. E. Knapp of Chanute, who went to the
field in 1899 and secured a number of paying wells. He
also obtained a market for his crude oil with the Omaha
and Kansas City gas companies, transporting the oil in
tank cars of his own. In the recent investigation in Kansas
it appeared that he had enlarged his business till he
had 20 tank cars in transit. He paid the railroads 10 cents
per hundred lbs. to Omaha and Kansas City, and they
counted the weight at 6.4 lbs. per gallon. With this rate
and ¾ of a cent mileage on his cars he was able to make a
good profit, but suddenly in May, 1902, two weeks after he
had signed a year’s contract with the gas companies, the
railroads changed the weight classification to 7.4 lbs. per
gallon, adding thereby $7.50 per car to the freight, while
the freight on the products of crude remained unchanged.
That is, the Standard could still ship gas-oil as a product
of crude at the old weight of 6.4 lbs. a gallon.<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c012'><sup>[299]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Knapp protested and the railroad agents, admitting
that the classification was arbitrary and not general even
on their own roads, succeeded in getting the order reversed,
but only for a short time, when back it went, and in reply
to further protest from the Kansas agents their superior
officers wrote that they were tired of the correspondence
and declined to discuss the matter further. So for 11
months Mr. Knapp had to fulfil his contract with a handicap
of $7.50 per car more cost than he had figured on.
The result was that in May, 1903, he turned over his crude
oil to the Standard which thereafter supplied the Omaha
and Kansas City gas companies, while Knapp’s 20 cars were
side-tracked and in the spring of 1905 were still idle at
Chanute.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weight classification killed Knapp’s business, but a
few small independents lived in spite of it. So another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>move was made on the railroad chess-board. Three great
railroads tap the Kansas oil fields: the Santa Fe, the Missouri,
Kansas and Texas, and the Missouri Pacific. In
August, 1904, just as the Standard finished its pipe line to
Kansas City, the rates on crude oil and its products were
raised by all the railroads on the field. The rate to Kansas
City went up from 10 cents to 17 cents a hundred; and
the rate to St. Louis rose from 15 cents to 22 cents. On a
carload of fifty-five thousand lbs. the increase in the freight
to Kansas City was $38.50, or $93.50 total, and $121 to
St. Louis. This was prohibitive. In their testimony given
in March last (1905), shippers, even those who were using
their own tank cars, declared that the change in rates
compelled them to stop business at once and shut down
their wells.</p>

<p class='c007'>The advance in freight was not a part of a general readjustment
of rates. It was made alone. And it made oil
rates out of all proportion to other rates. The freight from
Chanute to Kansas City was $50 for a car of wheat, $40
for corn, $66 for machinery, $28 for cattle, and $30 for a
car of fruit, against $93.50 for oil, the least valuable of all,
and formerly carried for $50 or $55 a car.</p>

<p class='c007'>The examiner at the recent Kansas investigation presented
the following letter in explanation of the railroads:
“The reason the Santa Fe and the ‘Katy’ railroads raised
rates on oil after the pipe line was completed was because
the Standard’s companies arranged with them to do so, by
agreeing to give them a percentage upon every barrel of oil
that was run through their pipe lines on condition the railroads
would increase the freight rate on oil to a prohibitive
rate, so that all the oil would be forced through the pipe
line. Now the railroads have no oil, but get about ten
cents per barrel for all oil going through the pipe lines.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This is similar to an arrangement that existed for several
years from 1884 on between the Pennsylvania Railroad and
the Oil Combine by which the railroad was to have a fixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>sum per barrel on 26 percent of all the oil going eastward
from the Pennsylvania oil fields, whether the oil went by
rail or pipe line,<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c012'><sup>[300]</sup></a> in consideration of which the railroad
was to put up the rates on oil.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Kansas case there are other reasons more direct
and powerful perhaps than any traffic arrangement. The
Standard people have acquired a large interest in the Santa
Fe. One of their strongest and most unscrupulous men,
H. H. Rogers, has taken a place on the board of directors.
John D. Rockefeller and Wm. Rockefeller are directors of
the Missouri, Kansas and Texas, and the Missouri Pacific
is one of the principal lines of the Gould-Rockefeller system.
There are other indications of the grip the Standard has
upon the Kansas railroads. For example, the Colorado
Fuel Company that was so greatly favored by the Santa
Fe is largely owned and managed by the Standard Oil
crowd, and the Standard uses the Santa Fe’s right of way
for its pipe lines in Kansas, and for almost the entire
distance from Kansas City to Whiting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kansas has risen in revolt against the Oil Trust, and the
Legislature last year (1905) lowered the freight rates on
oil and passed a bill for the establishment of a State refinery
to compete with the Standard and give the oil producers of
the State a chance to escape from the “commercial tyranny”
they are now subjected to in consequence of the fact that
there is practically only one buyer in the market. The State
Supreme Court, however, has decided that the State refinery
act is unconstitutional. The independents might, however,
establish a co-operative refinery of their own and do a good
business, if they could get equal freight rates and sufficient
support from public sentiment to withstand the boycott to
which the Standard would be likely to resort. Only the
Standard, it is said, can get rates that encourage the shipment
of oil from Kansas wells at present. And the Standard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>custom of putting prices very low where there is competition,
keeping prices high in other regions where there is no
competition, making the people in non-competitive localities
pay the cost of killing competition in other places, is exceedingly
effective, as is also its diabolical habit of ruining
merchants who buy independent oil, by establishing competing
houses close to them and underselling them on the
whole line of goods they handle, the Trust’s wide business
enabling it to stand such losses easily, as the total is only
an insignificant fraction of the profits made in regions
where no such fight is in progress.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE LONG-HAUL ANOMALY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The long and short haul clause is still broken by the railroads
as well as by the Supreme Court, especially in the
West and in the South, where the basing-point system
causes such grievous discriminations. For example, with
a rate of 48 cents from New York to Atlanta and a local
rate of 38 cents from Atlanta to Suwanee, the rate from
New York to Suwanee is 86 cents, although Suwanee is
31 miles nearer New York than Atlanta. This system is
not confined to places that have water competition. A
considerable number of towns on the Southern Railway
and on the Louisville and Nashville have been made
basing-points, though they have no water competition.<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c012'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Jacksonville is the main basing-point in Florida, and
rates to other destinations are the rate of Jacksonville
plus the local rate from Jacksonville to destination, even
though the destination is nearer the point of shipment
than Jacksonville.<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c012'><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>From New Orleans to the “Virginia Cities,” Richmond,
Lynchburg, and Norfolk, is about 800 miles. Charlotte,
at the southern border of North Carolina, is about half
way. Yet the rates to Charlotte on a number of articles
are double the rates to the Virginia cities, twice the distance.
The Southern Railway and the Seaboard Air Line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>reach the city, but there is no competition. Water competition
must be met in Virginia, but if the Virginia ton-mile
rate will pay a profit, is not the fourfold ton-mile
rate to Charlotte an exorbitant charge?<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c012'><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Danville is an excellent example of the evils of place discrimination.
Prior to 1886 Danville enjoyed equal freight
rates with Lynchburg and Richmond through the competition
of the Virginia Midland Railroad and the Southern
Railway, but in that year the Southern road (then known
as the Richmond and Danville) bought the Virginia Midland
and deprived Danville of its equal rates. In 1890
Danville subscribed $100,000 towards the construction of
another competing road, which was built, but after a few
years it too was purchased by the Southern Railway, and
the rates were made strongly adverse to Danville. The
matter went to the Commission and the courts, but the
city has not been able to carry on the litigation with
the roads.<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c012'><sup>[304]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Southern Railway carried bananas in 1902–1903
from Charleston to Lynchburg for 20 cents a hundred lbs.,
but if the fruit stopped at Danville, part way on the road
to Lynchburg, the rate was 43 cents a hundred. The
road said it had to make low rates at Lynchburg to meet
competing bananas coming in by way of Baltimore. The
Commission found, however, that the Lynchburg rate was
13 cents lower than the rate justified by competition from
Baltimore or elsewhere.<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c012'><sup>[305]</sup></a> It is claimed that railroad discrimination
has decreased the taxable values of Danville
several hundred thousand dollars from 1900 to 1904. The
Danville representative said, “I have heard a great deal
about confiscatory rates, fixed by a Commission authorized
to fix rates, but I have not heard anything about confiscatory
rates fixed by the railroads, whereby the property of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the public and of municipalities and taxable values are destroyed;
but those facts exist. They exist in my town,
and these facts exist in spite of the fact that the city
of Danville contributed $100,000 to the building of the
Lynchburg and Danville Railroad.”<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c012'><sup>[306]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The rate on canned goods from Hoopeston, Ill., to Nashville,
Tenn., is 27 cents per hundred. From Hoopeston
to Memphis, several hundred miles further, the rate is
19 cents. From Greenwood, Ind., to Nashville the rate
is 25 cents, to New Orleans 21 cents, to Mobile 20 cents,
and to Memphis 19 cents.<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c012'><sup>[307]</sup></a> The Chesapeake and Ohio
Railway, the Norfolk and Western, and the Baltimore and
Ohio, all carry lumber from the Blue Ridge Mountains.
The rate from the Shenandoah Valley to Philadelphia is 16
cents per hundred, while from points in the region a hundred
miles or so further west the rate is only 14 cents.
“The man who is producing lumber to-day on the eastern
slope of the Blue Ridge Mountains, almost within sight of
us, must pay 2 cents per hundred lbs. more to get lumber
to Philadelphia than the man 50 or 75 miles further
west, who gets his lumber transported for 14 cents. Now,
2 cents a hundred lbs. is 40 cents a ton. That is $12 a
carload of 30,000 lbs., and that is probably about all the
margin of profit there is in lumber of that kind.” All three
of the railroads are controlled by one great railroad system,
yet they claim that competition among them justifies
the lower rate in the region where they cross.<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c012'><sup>[308]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The rate on lumber from Chattanooga to Buffalo via

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Corn rates now (1905) are 13 cents per hundred from
Omaha, 1400 miles to New York, and 25 cents from Boone,
Iowa, 1252 miles to New York, 25 cents also from Dennison,
Iowa, 1341 miles to New York, etc. Many similar facts
might be named. And such discriminations between contiguous
markets do not violate the Interstate Law. There
is no requirement that one railroad line shall not charge
less for a given distance than another railroad line charges,
and even on the same line the long and short haul clause
yields to the necessity of meeting competition.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Dubuque wants to buy things from the South it
must pay much higher rates than Milwaukee, Madison,
Chicago, Freeport, etc. Manufacturers in Fort Dodge and
Dubuque, Iowa, have to pay higher rates to the Pacific
than manufacturers in Chicago and the East.</p>

<p class='c007'>Iowa raises corn, cattle, and hogs, and would like to have
packing-houses, but cannot because of the discrimination in
favor of Chicago and Missouri River points.<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c012'><sup>[310]</sup></a> Iowa business
men also say that small poultry and dressed-meat concerns
cannot compete with the big packers, on account of
the private-car system and the concessions granted the car-lines,
and they complain vigorously of the discrimination
against them in the rates on shoes, grain, cattle, iron,
steel, etc. The railroads have decreed that Iowa shall not
be a manufacturing State.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>The Chairman.</span> Why do you say that the railroads
have decreed that Iowa shall not become a manufacturing
State?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Hon. A. B. Cummins</span>, Governor of Iowa. I reach that
conclusion simply because all our manufacturers, when they
attempt to reach beyond our own State, meet rates that so

<p class='c007'>In many cases a shipper at an intermediate point between
Minneapolis and Chicago can send his grain to Minneapolis,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>rebill it to Chicago, and have it go back through his own
town to destination more cheaply than he can ship direct
to destination.<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c012'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>From Cannon Falls the rate to Chicago is 15 cents a
hundred on grain. The rate from Cannon Falls to Minneapolis
is 7 cents, and from Minneapolis to Chicago 7½
cents. So it costs ½ cent a hundred more to ship from
Cannon Falls direct to Chicago than to ship to Minneapolis
and from there back through Cannon Falls to Chicago.
And if he wants to send his grain to Louisville, Ky., it will
cost him 5 cents a hundred more to ship from Cannon Falls
to Louisville, than if he sends his grain to Minneapolis and
bills it from there to Louisville.<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c012'><sup>[312]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Denver still suffers from the sort of discrimination described
in the preceding section.<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c012'><sup>[313]</sup></a> The rate in cotton
goods from New England to Denver is $2.24 per hundred.
From New England to San Francisco, 1500 miles further
on, the rate is $1 a hundred in carload lots. On a shipment
in relation to which a Denver merchant made complaint,
the Burlington road received $25.95 from Chicago
to Denver, whereas if the same shipment had been intended
for Frisco the Burlington would have received only $4.50.</p>

<p class='c007'>Salt Lake City also is wrestling with adverse freight
rates. On cotton goods the rate from New York to Frisco
is $1, while on the shorter haul from New York to Salt
Lake it is just double, $2 per hundred.<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c012'><sup>[314]</sup></a> The rate on
window-shade cloth from New York to Salt Lake City is
$2.30. Carrying it 800 miles further, New York to California,
the railroads charge only $1, and this affords a slight
profit. Is it not clear that the $2.30 is excessive?<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c012'><sup>[315]</sup></a> “The
men who build a city in the interior cannot expect to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>as reasonable a rate as the men who build their city on the
shore of the sea, but the difference should be a reasonable
one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It would seem that the men who build in the interior
might expect that they would not be called on to pay railway
fixed charges on coast traffic as well as on their own.
It is unfair to give the coast people the celerity of railway
traffic at the cost of water traffic. The railroad theory that
every pound of freight is to be secured that will pay the
cost of hauling or a little more, though a water route or a
shorter rail line might carry the freight at less absolute
cost, is not in accord with sound public policy or the saving
of industrial power. It is an economic absurdity to haul by
rail what can go more cheaply and as safely by water. A
co-operative company or a consolidated company of any
honest and sensible variety, owning both the railroads and
the steamboat lines, would divide the traffic in such a way
as to secure the maximum economy and convenience, and
would make a reasonable payment for the extra speed and
other advantages of railway transit the main condition of
selecting that method of transportation, with an option in
the company under specified conditions to facilitate the
full loading of trains and boats through the adjustment of
rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case of Spokane is a specially aggravated one. The
rate on bar iron from Chicago to Spokane is $2.07 a hundred
against $1.25 to Seattle; iron pipe $1 to Spokane, 50
cents to Seattle; lamps $2.35 to Spokane, $1.10 to Seattle;
belting $3.13 to Spokane, and $1.65 to Seattle; mining-car
wheels $1.26 to Spokane and 85 cents to Seattle; cottons
$1.75 to Spokane, 90 cents to the coast; soap (toilet) $1.23
to Spokane, 75 cents to coast cities; wire and wire goods
$2.35 to Spokane, $1.50 to the coast; sewing machines
$2.25 to Spokane, $1.40 to coast; typewriters $5.96 to
Spokane, $3 to the cities of the coast.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>In general the rates from the East to Spokane are the

<p class='c007'>The preference which Tacoma, Seattle, etc., have over
Spokane is about 80 percent. Spokane pays about $1.80
on shipments from Chicago, while Tacoma and Seattle pay
$1.<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c012'><sup>[317]</sup></a> Spokane is a great railroad junction, but competition
has been suppressed by agreement between the lines, while
competition is still active at Tacoma and Seattle, so that
under the decision of the Supreme Court the railroads are
free to discriminate against Spokane. Aside from water
competition the railroads want to build up Seattle. They
have invested a great deal of money in docks and facilities
for doing business there. The manufacture of wooden
pipe was flourishing in Spokane. The company was shipping
2 carloads daily and its pay roll was $3,000 a month.
A rival factory in Seattle, backed by the big lumber firms
of the coast, got the railways to make rates that enabled it
to lay down the manufactured pipe in Spokane about 60
percent cheaper than the Spokane factory could make it.
The situation came to light November, 1903, two months
after the rates went into effect, when the Spokane factory
came into competition with the Seattle factory for a contract
at Butte. The bid of the Seattle firm was less than
the pipe could be sold for at Spokane by the factory in that
city, and Butte is 384 miles east of Spokane. The rates
shut off the Spokane factory from the East entirely. In
about 8 months that flourishing manufacture in Spokane
was wiped out.<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c012'><sup>[318]</sup></a> There was no water competition here
to make an excuse for discrimination, for the cut was
made from Seattle east to Spokane and points still further
east.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>The paper-box manufacture was forced out of existence
in Spokane by similar discriminations. Eastern factories
can lay down the boxes in Spokane cheaper than the local
factories can get the strawboard. So with other trades.
The manufacture of sash would be rapidly developed if it
were not for the grievous discrimination on window glass,
$1.38 from Pittsburg to Spokane, against 90 cents to Portland,
Seattle, etc.</p>

Commercial Club complains of discrimination in rates,
demurrage, switching, supply of cars, etc. The lumber
rate to Boston from points in West Virginia on the Norfolk

<p class='c007'>Even so important a city as Philadelphia has had serious
complaints to make at times of the favoritism shown New
York by sending many of the best trains from Washington
north through Philadelphia without running into Broad
Street Station, but stopping only at West Philadelphia,

<p class='c007'>In June, 1905, the New Haven and Hartford notified
connecting lines that it would not receive any further
shipments of coal for delivery east of the Connecticut River

constitutes a compound discrimination against certain
localities and a specific commodity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole of New England suffers from a discrimination
of about 100 percent in freight rates, the average rate in
New England being about double the average for the
United States. Quoting my testimony before the United
States Industrial Commission: “Another phase of discrimination
was brought out very prominently in our studies in
New England, and the best source of information, perhaps,
is the report made by the Massachusetts Railroad Commission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>a few years ago (1894), in which they compared the
average freight rate on New England roads, individual
roads, and the average of all the roads there, showing that
our rates were about double the average freight rate in the
Middle States, or in the Middle West, and that it was
clearly double what the average freight rate was for the
whole United States, and they argued with much force
that it was really a discrimination against New England as
a whole, especially against Boston. One of the pleas put
forward in discussing the question of leasing the Boston
and Albany was that the giving over of the Boston and
Albany to the New York Central control would intensify
instead of relieve that sectional discrimination against New
England as a whole, because the road would come under
the control of those interested chiefly in the development
of New York City, and not in the development of Boston
and the New England States.”<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c012'><sup>[324]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the Cincinnati Maximum Rate Case, involving a large
number of railways and steamship lines, the Commission
found discrimination between the rates from the eastern
seaboard and central territory to southern points, and fixed
a schedule of maximum rates from Cincinnati and Chicago
to Knoxville, Chattanooga, Rome, Atlanta, Meridian, Birmingham,
Anniston, and Selma, and required the railroads
to revise their rates to other points in the South in conformity
with the provisions of the order.<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c012'><sup>[325]</sup></a> On appeal to
the Supreme Court it was held that the order could not
be enforced against the railroads, it being the opinion of
the majority of the court that the Interstate Act does not
give the Commission power to fix rates, such power not
being expressly conferred and being too great to be implied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>from the prohibition of unreasonable rates and the general
authority given the Commission to enforce the law,<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c012'><sup>[326]</sup></a>
so that the discrimination the Commission sought to
abolish between different sections of the country is still
in operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sectional discrimination, either intentional or unintentional,
is bad enough, but there is a still wider and more
objectionable form of discrimination as between the country
and the big cities. The whole inland territory is made
tributary to a few competing points.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Hadley says: “The points where there is no competition
are made to pay the fixed charges.”<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c012'><sup>[327]</sup></a> The railroads
make whatever rates are necessary to get business on the
through routes, and compel the rural districts to pay rates
high enough to make up for the low rates on through
traffic. In many cases local rates in country districts are
almost as high as they were in the old stage-coach days.
Senator Dolliver suggests that every village and interior
community in the United States has a grievance against
the railways on account of discrimination against them in
favor of the large centres.<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c012'><sup>[328]</sup></a> Every small town, and every
small shipper and every farmer has to pay tribute to the
big cities. The effect is to build up the cities in wealth
and population at the expense of the country. For example,
while Indianapolis increased by 32,389 inhabitants from
1880 to 1890, 49 counties remained stationary, and 21
counties lost. So Detroit grew greatly, while 20 counties
in the State, nearly all the counties in Southern Michigan,
lost population. “It is manifest that the railroads are
greatly aiding the cities in drawing to themselves the best
and the worst from the country, and every moment are
increasing the magnitude of the municipal problem.”<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c012'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Mr. Alexander says that the railways should have credit
for decreasing the discriminations made by nature. “Thirty
years ago it cost over a dollar a pound to carry from New
York machinery and tools to work the mines of Utah, and
the trip consumed the whole summer, during which the
purchaser lost the use of his money. Now the trip requires
but two weeks or less, and the rate is about two cents.
Comparing these rates, and considering the character of
the present service as compared with the old, it is not an
exaggeration to say that the railroads have removed about
ninety-nine one-hundredths of the discrimination against
Utah which nature ordained in surrounding her with
deserts and mountains.”<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c012'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that the railways have greatly reduced the obstacles
of nature, but it is also true that they have used
their power of reduction unequally, arbitrarily, and unjustly.
The discriminations of nature have not the quality
of justice or injustice that attaches to discrimination by
human agencies. In the exercise of the function of removing
the difficulties of nature the common carrier must
be impartial.</p>

<p class='c006'>The railroads continue to nullify the protective tariff upon
imports, and erect a counter protective tariff of their own
in favor of foreign goods and against domestic manufactures,
aiming to supply home markets, while on the other
hand they facilitate the export of our productions by rates
much lower than the charges on the same goods for the

<p class='c007'>The Industrial Commission found that merchandise for
export went from Chicago to New York at 80 percent of
the ordinary transportation rates, and grain from Kansas
City to Chicago took 3 cents a hundred lower rate if billed
for export than if intended for local consumption.<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c012'><sup>[331]</sup></a> The
export rate on wheat from Chicago to New York is 15 cents,
the domestic rate 20 cents; from Kansas City to Galveston

33½ cents.<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c012'><sup>[332]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Another recent investigation shows that wheat from
Kansas City to Galveston was paying 27 cents if for domestic
use, against 10 cents if intended for export. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>rates fluctuate, but if the domestic rate flies low the foreign
rate flies lower still.</p>

<p class='c007'>The price of grain in Liverpool is determined by world
competition; the railroads cut rates so that our grain can
be sold in Liverpool. They get a little more than the cost
of hauling and are satisfied.</p>

<p class='c007'>When oil is selling at 9 cents a gallon here it can be
bought at 3 cents for shipment to Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Railroads often give manufacturers a reduction of
33⅓ percent for export, and manufacturers sell at 30 percent
less for export. Mr. Bacon told the Senate Committee
(1905) that the export rates from all inland points to the
seaboard have been for years 25 to 33 percent below the
rates on goods for domestic use.<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c012'><sup>[333]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The rate on rails from Pittsburg to Hongkong via San
Francisco is only 60 cents per hundred, or less than the
rate between points a few hundred miles apart in this
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For the past two years the trunk lines have given the
steel and iron producers a reduction of 33⅓ percent less
than the published tariff on domestic freights, so that all
iron and steel exported is carried at one-third less than the
people of this country are required to pay on freight of the
same character.”<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c012'><sup>[334]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>American steel has sold at Belfast for $24 a ton, while
purchasers in this country had to pay $32 a ton at Pittsburg
for the same steel.<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c012'><sup>[335]</sup></a> American rails sell for $28 a ton
for home use, but for foreign use they can be bought in
New York for $19 a ton and delivered in Beirut for $22.88.
Last year Mr. Wright, general manager of the Macon and
Savannah Railroad, stated that his road had to pay $29 a
ton for 5,618 tons of steel rails, although the same steel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>company offered him rails for Honduras at $20 loaded on
vessels chartered to a foreign port.<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c012'><sup>[336]</sup></a> During the last three
or four years, while the home price has been $28, the price
for export has been $5 to $12 below the home price, and
during the period 1902–1904 the difference has been $8 to
$12. The Great Northern and the Northern Pacific pay $28
a ton for rails, while their competitor, the Canadian Pacific,
buys the same rails for $20 a ton and sometimes for $18 a
ton.<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c012'><sup>[337]</sup></a> Even the United States Government could not get
fair prices at home for the materials and supplies needed
for the Panama Canal project, and found it necessary to
open the competition to foreign bids. Even if it were determined
to use only American goods they could be bought
more cheaply abroad than at home. Matters are arranged
so that goods are hauled across the ocean to Europe and
then hauled back and sold here at lower prices than they
could be bought for at the factory here for home use. If
the railways and the steamboats and the allied interests
make money they do not care how much industrial power
is wasted.</p>

<p class='c007'>An investigation last year brought out the interesting
fact that the cheapest way sometimes to get goods from
Chicago to San Francisco is to ship from Chicago across
the Pacific Ocean and then back to California. The Interstate
Commission says: “The complainant desired to ship
the machinery for a stamp mill from Chicago to China.
Being interested in a line of steamships between San Francisco
and the East, his intention was to make shipment to
San Francisco and thus to destination by his own line.
Upon investigation, however, he learned that the rate from
Chicago to San Francisco was $1.25 per hundred lbs., while
from Chicago to Shanghai it was 90 cents per hundred lbs.
The rate at that time from Shanghai to San Francisco was
20 cents per hundred lbs. Had he desired to lay down his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>stamp mill at San Francisco, he could have shipped it to
Shanghai, and from Shanghai back for 15 cents per hundred
lbs. less than the direct rate from Chicago to San
Francisco.”<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c012'><sup>[338]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>President Tuttle of the Boston and Maine tells of a cargo
of flour carried from the Pacific Coast around the Horn to
England and then back to Boston to be delivered to a
starch factory at Watertown. “A sailing vessel had gone
to the Pacific coast with goods from Europe. There was
some lack of a cargo for return. They found a lot of soft
wheat flour there with which they loaded that vessel and
carried it to Liverpool and put it in storage. Then the
owner of the flour began to hunt around the world for a
market, and found that within ten miles of Boston he could
sell that flour to a starch factory at a profit and pay for the
additional land haul of 10 miles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>The Chairman.</span> It first went to Liverpool?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Tuttle.</span> Went from San Francisco around the
Horn to Liverpool and then across the Atlantic back to
Boston. In order to carry that flour to Watertown, across
the continent by rail, the railroads would have had to make
a rate which was practically nothing, because the transportation
by water is so extremely low that you cannot put
the railway rate against it and make a profit. The cost of
carriage of a ton of freight by a large steamer is so low that
there is hardly any way to figure it. We have to meet
those conditions. That is what we are doing.”<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c012'><sup>[339]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The low rates on imports enable European manufacturers
to ship their goods to our western States more cheaply than
our own eastern manufacturers can send their goods to the
West. Rates on imports are frequently only a third of
rates on domestic goods over the same lines,<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c012'><sup>[340]</sup></a> and sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>the difference is greater yet. And it is not confined
to manufacturers. Thousands of acres of Kaolin mines
from which the finest chinaware can be made are idle in
the region round Macon, Ga., because clay can be shipped
from England to Ohio factories cheaper than it can go from
Macon to Ohio. Several mining companies have had to
quit business because of foreign competition favored by low
import freight rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both export and import reductions lead to serious
discriminations, not merely as between our people and foreigners,
but among our cities and shippers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unscrupulous shippers take advantage of the export rates
in the domestic trade, billing their freight on the export
basis. Grain, for example, is “billed for export” to Chicago
or New York or other centre; and then “the destination
is changed in transit,” that is, after the grain or other
shipment gets to Chicago or New York, the shipper stops
it there, or orders it to Albany or Worcester or otherwise
changes the destination.<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c012'><sup>[341]</sup></a> The same thing is done in the
packing-house trade to New York. The Vanderbilt traffic
manager says: “Our domestic business does not amount to
anything.” About all the dressed beef that goes east appears
to be for export. When asked how the eastern territory
got its dressed beef, the manager said: “I could not
give you any information on that point.”<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c012'><sup>[342]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Such results are worse even than the difference between
the export rate on wheat and on flour, which tends to discourage
the milling of wheat in this country and throw into
the hands of foreign millers business that belongs to our millers.
Worse than this or than the discouragement of home
manufactures by cut rates on imports, is the discrimination
in the export and import rates in respect to different ports.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One of the most remarkable trade movements of recent
times is the growth of the Gulf ports at the expense of New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>York and other Atlantic ports. New Orleans has become
the second largest grain-exporting port, and gives promise
of becoming the first. Galveston’s export and import trade
is rapidly increasing. In 1897 New York handled 77.9 percent
of the wheat, corn, and flour exports, and in 1904 her
share had dwindled to 36.9 percent. The Gulf ports have
made corresponding or greater increases. Natural advantages,
including proximity to supply centres, and the
extension of port facilities for handling cargoes, have had
something to do with this increase of exports from the Gulf
ports, but the chief factor has been the differentials made
by railroads connecting with those ports. So alarming is
the decrease of commerce through the port of New York
that an effort is being made to secure a legislative investigation
of the subject.”<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c012'><sup>[343]</sup></a> The Chairman of the Committee
on Foreign Commerce for the Baltimore Chamber of Commerce
says: “We are gradually shrivelling up because of
discrimination in freight rates. Ever since December last,
1904, when the grain rates were advanced 1 to 1½ cents on
export grain and 3 cents for domestic delivery, business in
this city has almost come to a standstill.... The Gulf ports
are getting it all, and while millions of bushels of corn were
accustomed to arrive here, after the December marketing
from the Southwest, not one has been received since the
first of the year. Firms formerly engaged in the exporting
business in this city have pulled up stakes and have gone
to New York in search of better railroad opportunities....
The Chamber of Commerce here is meeting daily to devise
a means of surmounting the danger which now threatens
the export business of Baltimore.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Government is forbidden to favor one port more
than another, but the railroads are left free with a power
of favoritism greater than any the Government possesses, and
they are using the power as we have seen. Section 9, of
Article 1, of the Federal Constitution says: “No preference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>shall be given by any regulation of commerce in revenue to
ports of one State over those of another.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Congress itself cannot establish any differential that
would give one port of the United States an advantage
over another port. But what the Constitution forbids
Congress to do the railroads can do and have done, by
manipulating the rates on exports and imports, thereby
making business flow to whatever ports they please.</p>

The cases on record do not exhaust the possibilities of discriminations.
The following bit of testimony shows how
easy it is to invent new ways of passing railroad moneys
into the treasuries of favored shippers,—ways that would
not be interfered with by any law short of public control
of the purchase and sale of merchandise. Mr. Gavin,
the agent of the Vandalia line, was being examined by the
Interstate Commerce Commission in March, 1901. On the
question as to how business could be got by giving advantages
to shippers without cutting rates Mr. Gavin said:
“There is nothing to prevent my going down to the packing-house
and paying $10 apiece for hams if I wanted to;
if I did not want to cut a rate, there is generally a way out
of the hole.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner Clements.</span> A good many ways; and
it is your belief that a good many of these have been
practised, is it not?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Gavin.</span> I do not know. I would not like to say.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner Prouty.</span> If you bought hams enough
at $10 apiece the packing-house could give you the traffic at
full rates?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Gavin.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner Prouty.</span> Have you ever known that
to be done?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Gavin.</span> No, sir; but I say there are lots of ways
out of the woods.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost everybody agrees, in public, that railway favoritism
ought to be stopped.<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c012'><sup>[346]</sup></a> It disturbs the fair distribution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>of wealth, undermines industrial justice, business morals,
and political honesty; builds monopoly; wastes resources,
and causes enormous loss to the railroads as well as to the
persons and places that are discriminated against.</p>

<p class='c007'>Railway discrimination breaks down the equality of
opportunity that is one of the fundamental rights recognized
in every country. It tends to separate success from
merit and industry, and make it depend on fraud and
favoritism. Judge Grosscup touched a vital point when
he said to the Boston Economic Club, March 11, 1905:
“Any difference in rates permitted by law, even though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>based on the bulk of the tonnage handled, is a direct and
effective blow, by the nation itself, at the principle that
every man, whatever his present business size, shall be
given equal conditions and equal opportunity.... In this
country there is no such thing as size to a business man.
The man of little size expects to get big. He has a right
to get big. He has a right to have the atmosphere of
equal opportunity and equal conditions in which to grow,
and excepting, of course, some unit, such as a ton or a car,
the charge ought to be the same for the little as for the big
shipper.”<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c012'><sup>[347]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The railways are public highways, they exercise governmental
powers and fulfil governmental functions, and it is
an atrocious misuse of social power to employ these so as to
give special advantages to a few members of the community.
The Interstate Commission says: “The railroad
is justly regarded as a public facility which every person
may enjoy at pleasure, a common right to which all are
admitted and from which none can be excluded. The
essence of this right is equality, and its enjoyment can be
complete only when it is secured on like conditions by all
who desire its benefits. The railroad exists by virtue of
authority proceeding from the State, and thus differs in
its essential nature from every form of private enterprise.
The carrier is invested with extraordinary powers which
are delegated by the sovereign, and thereby performs a governmental
function. The favoritism, partiality, and exactions
which the law was designed to prevent resulted in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>large measure from a general misapprehension of the nature
of transportation, and its vital relation to commercial and
industrial progress. So far from being a private possession,
it differs from every species of property, and is in no
sense a commodity. Its office is peculiar, for it is essentially
public. The railroad, therefore, can rightfully do nothing
which the State itself might not do if it performed this
public service through its own agents, instead of delegating
it to corporations which it has created. The large shipper
is entitled to no advantage over his smaller rival in respect
to rates or accommodations, for the compensation exacted
in every case should be measured by the same standard.
To allow any exceptions to this fundamental rule is to subvert
the principle upon which free institutions depend, and
substitute arbitrary caprice for equality of right.”<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c012'><sup>[348]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The losses to the railroads cannot be estimated accurately,
but we have some interesting hints. Franklin B. Gowan
said in 1888: “The gross receipts of the railroads of this
country, in round numbers, are eight hundred millions of
dollars per annum, and I verily and honestly believe that
one hundred millions of dollars annually are taken out of
the pockets of the people of this country by unjust railway
discrimination, and turned over to this privileged class—and
this is equal to a tax of two dollars per head paid by
the people for the sake of building up the new aristocracy
of wealth that in this free country arrogate to themselves
the position of the nobility of the older countries. It is
utterly impossible that there can be any success attending
a monopoly of natural products without the aid of the unjust
discrimination of railroad companies. And only when
such discrimination ceases will all people be placed on terms
of equality.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If the losses were more than $100,000,000 a year when
the total income of the railroads was $800,000,000 a year,
the losses now with an income of about $2,000,000,000 a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>year are probably, at least, $200,000,000 a year, allowing
for all the saving that is claimed to have resulted from the
Elkins Act. A railroad officer who says his road has constantly
disregarded the Interstate Commerce Law declares
that in more than one year the net revenues of his company
“would have been increased by more than 15 percent if no
rebates had been paid to favored customers.” The hundreds
of millions which the transportation systems of this
country have, during the period from 1887 to 1905, earned
and repaid to the men who controlled the large industrial
products of the country—coal, iron, grain, salt, sugar, oil,
provisions, and lumber—belonged equitably to employees
and stockholders (or to the people). “And the history of
this period may be repeated as often as the whim or the
interest of a traffic manager or owning director prompts or
requires.”<a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c012'><sup>[349]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The losses through the disturbance of business, interference
with the relation between energy and industry on one
side and success on the other, depression of localities, and
ruin of individuals, are beyond computation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most shippers would be glad to do away with discrimination
if they could be sure that there would be a square deal
all round, fair play, and no concessions to their rivals. And
most railroad men would be glad to be protected against the
discriminations that are forced upon them by the shippers,
and by competition among the roads, if they could be sure
that the published rates would really be adhered to by their
competitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Law after law has been passed to prevent unjust discriminations,
and yet in spite of the contrary statements
of some witnesses,<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c012'><sup>[350]</sup></a> it is perfectly clear that they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>not ceased, and that comparatively little has been done in
that direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Railroad men in high position declare that discriminations
always will exist. President Ripley of the Santa Fe
says: “The situation is practically remediless. I think
it will always be.”<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c012'><sup>[351]</sup></a> President J. J. Hill of the Great
Northern says: “You may say there shall be no discrimination.
But that condition will never exist. If there
were no discrimination the people would come down here
in great throngs and ask you to authorize discrimination.
We have to discriminate.”<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c012'><sup>[352]</sup></a> When I asked President
Fish of the Illinois Central how discriminations could be
stopped he said: “Tell me how to enforce the Ten Commandments
and I’ll tell you how to stop discriminations.”
Another railroad president, whose name I am not at liberty
to give, said in reply to the same question: “Discriminations
will never cease so long as there is competition
among the railroads, or political favors and protection can
be secured thereby, or railways and railway men are interested
in other businesses than transportation.” President
Hill also recognizes the factor of special self-interest in
addition to the influence of competition. He says: “I
think that every railway officer in this country should
be disqualified from having any interest, directly or indirectly,
in any large producer of traffic, whether it is
a coal mine or a factory or a mill or anything else, on a
line of railway where he is on the pay roll.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“<span class='sc'>Senator Clapp.</span> And the reason for that suggestion
is what?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Hill.</span> That he cannot be fair to the other fellow
and punish himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Clapp.</span> And the opportunity is such that
it cannot be detected and prevented?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Hill.</span> It is so easy, if there is a great demand
for coal in one direction, or for some commodity
in one place, for him to help one fellow and forget the
other.”<a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c012'><sup>[353]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>One of the gravest dangers lies in the fact that men who
are largely interested in the great industrial corporations
control certain railway lines and have large influence
with many others. The interlocking of railroad interests
with other industrial interests is a cause of discrimination
second only to the pressure of railroad competition for
traffic that is used by shippers as a means of extorting the
favors they desire.</p>

<p class='c007'>A railroad executive writing in <cite>The Outlook</cite> for July 1,
1905 says: “Notwithstanding the violations of the Interstate
Commerce Law have been open and notorious, and
indictments have been numerous and prosecutions not
infrequent, no railroad officer has ever been incarcerated.
For my own part, the penal liability for such disobedience
has never in any wise deterred my purpose to secure
my company’s share of tonnage by whatever means competitors
employed. I have the reputation of a law-abiding
citizen in my home city—am well known—of good
personal character. I flatter myself that a jury could
not be found which would commit me as a felon because I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>directed the payment of a rebate to a shipper—a transaction
which did not inure to my financial advantage.
Could a jury be found that would exact a felon’s punishment
for such men as Mr. Stuyvesant Fish, or Mr. Secretary
Paul Morton, or Mr. Marvin Hughitt for disobeying a
statute in order that the revenues of the company by
which he was employed might not be decimated?” He
had previously said that the revenues of the railroads
have been decimated by hundreds of millions through
the granting of discriminations, but he argues that the
revenues of any particular railroad that should refuse
concessions would be decimated still more largely. The
truth of this contention is strongly illustrated by the
following incident. Some years ago Judge Taft (now
Secretary of War), as receiver for the “Cloverleaf” Railroad
from Toledo to St. Louis, appointed Mr. Samuel
Hunt of Cincinnati, a well-known and successful railroad
manager, and required him to comply strictly with the
Interstate Law. In doing this Mr. Hunt was obliged
“to disregard many outstanding rebate obligations of his
predecessor in the receivership, thereby giving offence to
many patrons of the road and their friends, the result
of which was a decrease of the gross earnings of the road
within twenty months of more than $340,000.” The
sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of dollars, the loss of
the good-will of shippers, the harsh criticism of competitors,
and broken health were the results of Mr. Hunt’s
earnest efforts to obey the law. M. E. Ingalls, President
of the Big Four, said a few years ago to a convention of
State railroad commissioners: “Men managing large corporations,
who would trust their opponent with their
pocket-book with untold thousands in it will hardly trust
his agreement for the maintenance of tariffs while they
are in the room together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The railway official who desires to be honest sees
traffic leave his line.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“The result is these men in despair are driven to do
just what their opponents are doing. They become lawbreakers
themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No one is going to try and send his competitor to
prison. Besides, there is the fear that he himself may
have committed transgressions which in turn will be discovered
and punishment inflicted upon himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unless some change is made, the small shippers of the
country will be extinguished, and a few men of large
capital will control the entire merchandise business. And
railways&#160;... will be seized upon by large capitalists and
combined into one monstrous company.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br /> <span class='large'>DIFFICULTIES OF ABOLISHING DISCRIMINATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is difficult to enforce the law against discrimination,
because of the strong interests that call for it, the secrecy
of many of its forms, the reluctance of shippers to make
complaints for fear of persecution, and the resistance
offered by railway officers to efforts to get at the facts,
leaving the country during an investigation, refusing to
answer truthfully on the witness stand, burning books
and papers that might reveal the facts to courts or other
investigating bodies or enable the officers to refresh their
memories so as to be able to answer questions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Often there are no records of the concessions granted
favored shippers except the memoranda in the personal
note-books of the traffic managers. Rebates or commissions
are frequently paid by messenger boys sent from
the general freight office, or treasurer’s office, with the
currency and a slip of paper with some pencil marks on
it, instead of sending a check and obtaining a voucher.<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c012'><sup>[354]</sup></a>
The officers forget about the transaction as soon as possible,—sooner
than possible it seems sometimes,—or in
some other way try to prevent the Commission from getting
the facts with sufficient detail to bring suits. For
example, in the “Dressed-meat” Hearing at Kansas City,
March 21, 1901, fifteen transportation men were subpœnaed
and examined without securing any important facts. The
witnesses, who occupied positions which would naturally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>lead one to suppose they would know all about the matters
in hand, manifested the most persistent and remarkable
ignorance, and the Commission had to go to Chicago and
try again before it got any light on the packing-house
transportation question.</p>

<p class='c007'>In March, 1898, the Interstate Commission investigated
rebates on flour from St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Duluth
to Atlantic seaports. The Commission had information of
wide departures from the published tariff. It says: “The
inquiry was greatly hampered by the disappearance of
material witnesses before subpœnas for their attendance
could be served, the inability of several who did testify
to recall transactions there of recent date, and the evident
reluctance of others to disclose any information bearing on
the subject involved. All of the railway witnesses denied
knowledge of any violation of the statute, and most of the
accounting officers testified to the effect that if rebates had
been paid they would necessarily know about them, and
that their accounts did not show any such payments. It
was nevertheless fully established by the investigation that
secret concessions had been generally granted on this traffic,
and that the carriers had allowed larger rebates to some
shippers than to others.”<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c012'><sup>[355]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>After the St. Paul investigation in 1898 the Commission
entered on an investigation at Portland, Ore., in respect
to rates between the coast and points on and east of the
Missouri River. “It was established by the proof that
secret rates generally prevailed at Portland and common
points, and that transportation was, in effect, sold to the
lowest bidder. The lawful rates were ignored, except as
they might serve as a standard in making agreements for
lower charges.... Some of the merchants conformed to
the law, but in so doing they were at a disadvantage in
competing with those who disregarded the statute; and
in many instances this disadvantage represented more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>a fair profit upon the commodities involved. Most of the
merchants who admitted that they had thus violated the
law declared themselves unable to remember who paid them
the rebates, or when or upon what shipments any illegal
rate concessions had been made. Some testified that they
had kept account of the unlawful transactions, but that
when they heard of this investigation they destroyed their
memoranda in order to defeat prosecutions on account of
their illegal acts. They insisted that without these data
they could give no specific testimony concerning any of
the transactions.”<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c012'><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Commission found in these and other investigations
that “unlawful rebates have been and are being paid by a
great number of carriers,” but they could not get the specific
evidence necessary for prosecutions.<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c012'><sup>[357]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In its Report for 1904, p. 104, the Commission says:
“Railroad officials often seem to think that it is their duty
to withhold facts, on account of some real or supposed
liability to make disclosures that will impair the railroad’s
rights or interests in future judicial proceedings. Some
companies seem to have adopted a settled policy to give
the least possible information, at all times, on any and all
subjects.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Discussing the continuance of the payment of rebates
and the reasons the Interstate Commission has not been
able to stop the practice, Commissioner Prouty says:<a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c012'><sup>[358]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“When I first came onto the Interstate Commerce Commission
(1897), I used to see continually in the newspapers
statements like these: ‘Rates sadly demoralized,’ ‘agreement
between railroad officers to restore rates,’ and everything
of that sort. I said to my associates, ‘Gentlemen,
this thing will not do; we must stop the payment of
rebates.’ They said, ‘How are you going to stop the payment
of the rebates?’ I said, ‘We are going to call these
gentlemen before us; we are going to put them under
oath, and we are going to make them admit they paid these
rebates, and we are going to use the evidence which we
obtain to convict them.’ We employed Mr. Day, who is
now with the Department of Justice. The rates which
have been almost uniformly demoralized have been the
grain rates from Chicago to the Atlantic seaboard. We
called in the chief traffic officials of all these lines and we
put them under oath. Now, I would ask these gentlemen,
‘Are you the chief traffic official of this road?’ ‘I am.’
‘Would you know it if a rebate was paid?’ ‘I would.’
‘Are any rebates paid on your road?’ ‘There are none.’
‘The rates are absolutely maintained?’ ‘They are.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, every traffic official who came before us in that
capacity—and we prosecuted it for three days at Chicago—testified
that rates were absolutely maintained.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Newlands.</span> How many did you have before
you?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Prouty.</span> We had the official of every trunk
line leading from Chicago to New York. They all testified
the rates were absolutely maintained from Chicago
to New York. Two years after that I examined the
chief traffic officer of the Baltimore and Ohio, and of
the New York Central—do not think it was the same man
in either case—and of the other lines, and they all testified
that rates had never been maintained. I would like
to know what I could do as Interstate Commerce Commissioner
to make those gentlemen admit that they paid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>rebates, and as they would not tell that they paid rebates,
I would be glad to know how I could obtain evidence that
they did.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Having gotten through, Senator, with the lines between
Chicago and New York, we said perhaps this is not a fair
sample. Now, we will go up in the Northwest, and we
will take the lines that carry flour from Minneapolis east.
We instituted another investigation, and we put the railroad
and the traffic men of the millers on the stand, and
they all swore without exception that the rates were absolutely
maintained. One traffic official there, when it got a
little bit too hot for him, became sick enough so that he
threw up his dinner, but he did not throw up the truth.
We could not get the admission from any man there that
they had ever paid a rebate. We said, ‘This does for the
East; now let us go West.’ So we went into the Pacific
Coast, to Portland, Oregon, and went over exactly the
same performance there. We made one man admit that he
burned up his books rather than present them to the Commission,
but we could obtain no admission of the payment
of any rebate there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the St. Louis Southwestern Traffic Committee or
Traffic Association employed a young man by the name
of Camden and instructed him to lay before the Interstate
Commission any evidence he got of the payment
of rebates. “He had not been there more than two or
three weeks before he found some evidence to the effect
that the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had been departing
from the published rate, and he came up to Washington
and laid that evidence before the Interstate Commerce
Commission, and we began proceedings against the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad. That was the first instance from
the time I came onto the Commission that we could obtain
any evidence of a departure from the published rate. We
directed the Baltimore and Ohio road to file a statement
showing what shipments they had made during a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>time, and the rate of freight paid them for the transportation.
Thereupon they filed a statement showing a great
many departures from the published rate. At the same
time they sent to the Interstate Commerce Commission a
letter. They said in that letter in substance, that the roads
in the territory in which they operated had habitually
departed from the published rate; that was after they had
sworn they maintained the published rate in that territory:
‘Now, for us, the receivers of the Baltimore and Ohio, we
have gotten through, but we cannot maintain the rate
unless our competitors maintain the rate. We propose
from this time on to maintain the rate ourselves, and we
propose to see that they maintain it; but in order that we
may do that, we ask you to call a conference of the railroad
presidents in trunk-line territory.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now the Commission did, acting on that suggestion,
invite every president of the trunk-line railroads to come
to Washington. They came, all of them. Mr. Calloway
was there for the New York Central; Mr. Thompson was
there for the Pennsylvania Railroad; Mr. Murray and Mr.
Cowan came there for the Baltimore and Ohio; Mr. Harris
came from the Philadelphia and Reading, and Mr. Walters
was there for the Lehigh Valley. I do not remember them
all, but they all came there. Those gentlemen all said:
‘It is true; we have departed from the published rate.
We did not like to do it, but we did. But we have gotten
through. We shall depart from the published rate no
more. If you gentlemen will only let bygones be bygones,
we assure you that in the future there will be no discrimination
under this law.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I expect, perhaps, that we ought to have said to
them, ‘You are a pack of consummate liars; we do not believe
anything you say, and we will prosecute you if we
can. But we did not think so; we believed exactly what
they said, and we told them we did, and they went home,
and no prosecutions were begun on the facts which we had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>against the Baltimore and Ohio. Then we called, at the
request of certain persons in the West, the presidents of all
those lines, and they all came. Mr. Marvin Hughitt came;
Mr. Bird, of the Milwaukee line, came; in all, 30 or 40;
and we had the same sort of an experience meeting again.
They all said: ‘We have sinned, but we have got through.
Now, gentlemen, just help us to maintain the Act to regulate
commerce.’ We said: ‘We will do it.’ And they
went home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, I do not wish to pass any criticism at all on these
gentlemen. I have not the slightest doubt that they meant
precisely what they said. I think I know something about
the difficulties under which they labored; but they did not
maintain those rates for a month, probably.... There
has not been a time since I have been an Interstate Commerce
Commissioner, when, if the traffic officers of the
trunk lines between Chicago and the Atlantic seaboard
would have consented to tell the truth under oath, the Interstate
Commerce Commission would not have stopped
the payment of rebates. I have been able to discover no
way in which to make them tell the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Newlands.</span> In regard to the future, will it
not be possible for them to commence again this system of
rebates?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Prouty.</span> I think they pay rebates now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Newlands.</span> You think they do?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Prouty.</span> I think they do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Victor Morawetz, Chairman of the Executive Committee
of the Santa Fe, was asked if it would not be wise to require
the traffic manager of each railroad, the auditor, and
the president, to report every three months on all existing
contracts, and that there had been no violations of law,
no abuses, so far as they knew, and that they had made
diligent inquiry to ascertain if there had been. Morawetz
replied that if such a law were passed some men
would perjure themselves every three months, and others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>who were thoroughly honest would simply not take
office.<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c012'><sup>[359]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Not all the railway officers refuse to tell the truth.
There is every reason to believe that Paul Morton and Mr.
Biddle of the Santa Fe, for example, spoke the truth in
their testimony before the Commission. But the evidence
seems to be that the habit of truth telling is not very prevalent.
And when the railroad officers determine to prevent
publicity either by falsehood or by silence they take
care to eliminate documentary evidence that might be
used to checkmate them. They destroy their records so
that they will be less liable to know anything about the
rebates they have paid, and to make it as hard as possible
for the Interstate Commerce Commission to get at the
facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Commission is examining Mr. McCabe, freight traffic
manager of the Pennsylvania lines west of Pittsburg.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Commissioner Clements.</span> Are you in the habit of

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>The shippers who receive rebates, etc., adopt similar
measures to keep their modest affairs from the public.
In April, 1904, the newspapers reported that the Interstate
Commerce Commission was going to Boston to investigate
rebates and private car-line abuses. The office force of
the Armour office at Boston was immediately set to work
packing into barrels all letters and records that might
show a combination or understanding among the houses
or with the railroads, or other inconvenient matters, and
all these dangerous documents were incontinently fed to
the furnaces.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, shippers who are not of the favored
class are afraid to complain for fear of persecution by delay
of freight, overcharges, prolonged litigation of every difference
or dispute, and probable intensification in some
form of the discrimination in favor of their competitors.
The Oregon Commission says: “The shipper preferred to
tamely submit to the injustice put upon him through discriminations
against him or unreasonable and extortionate
charges and exactions for transportation facilities, than to
hazard the utter ruin of his business by provoking the
animosities of managers if he carried his grievances into
the courts in order to have his rights determined and
enforced.... Besides, if the shipper went to court with
his grievances he was confronted by powerful and wealthy
corporations who contested, with the aid of the ablest
counsel money could procure, every inch of the ground in
the controversy, thus making each contest between the
individual shipper and these corporations an unequal one
in proportion to the ability of the shipper personally to
press his case as compared with the financial ability of the
corporations.”<a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c012'><sup>[363]</sup></a> In a large majority of cases the loss sustained
by the individual through favoritism or extortion is
less than the probable injury resulting from litigation with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>powerful corporations employing the ablest counsel, contesting
every inch of ground, defeating or delaying redress
by every possible means, and squeezing the plaintiff meanwhile
perhaps with a grip upon his business that means
death to his prosperity, so that the shipper thinks it better
to bear the ills he has than fly to others to which he has
not been introduced.</p>

<p class='c006'>Coming now to consider how railway favoritism may be

scale of taxation to apply in inverse ratio to the fairness
and openness of the railway administration, so that a railroad
opening its books freely to inspection and treating all fairly
and impartially would pay low taxes, while a railroad acting
on opposite principles would be taxed at a high rate.<a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c012'><sup>[379]</sup></a>
The enactment of the Commerce Act by all the States and
territories so that the State and Federal laws may be in harmony,
and State and national commissions can co-operate
in shutting out discrimination from local and through
traffic,<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c012'><sup>[380]</sup></a> is also suggested. Another view is that only public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>ownership of the railroads under thorough civil service
regulations can eliminate either the motives or the power
to discriminate,—the antagonism of public and private
interests being the tap-root of discrimination, it can be
fully overcome only by pulling up the root and making
railroad managers the agents of the public to run the roads
for the public service instead of being the agents of private
interests to operate the roads for private profit.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>In his message of December, 1904, President Roosevelt
urged Congress to give the Interstate Commission power
“to revise rates and regulations, the revised rate to go into
effect at once and to stay in effect, unless and until the
court of review reverses it.” He laid especial emphasis
upon the necessity of stopping rebates and unjust discriminations,
saying: “Above all else, we must strive to keep the
highways of commerce open to all on equal terms; and to
do this it is necessary to put a complete stop to all rebates.”
In his message of December, 1905, the President alters his
recommendation to the granting of power to fix a “maximum
reasonable rate, the decision to go into effect within
a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject
to review by the courts.” In case a “favorite shipper
is given too low a rate,” the President says, “the Commission
would have the right to fix this already established
minimum rate as the maximum; and it would need only
one or two such decisions by the Commission to cure railroad
companies of the practice of giving improper minimum
rates.” (See below, recommendations of the New York
Board of Trade, from which, perhaps, the President took
this suggestion.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The President says the law should make it clear that
unfair commissions and fictitious damages, free passes,
reduced passenger rates and payments of brokerage, are
illegal; and that it might be wise “to confer on the Government
the right of civil action against the beneficiary of a
rebate for at least twice the value of the rebate; this would
help stop what is really blackmail. Elevator allowances
should also be stopped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All private car-lines, industrial roads, refrigerator
charges, and the like should be expressly put under the
supervision of the Interstate Commission or some similar
body.... Neither private cars nor industrial railroads,
nor spur-tracks should be utilized as devices for securing
preferential rates. A rebate in icing charges or in mileage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>or in a division of the rate for refrigerating charges is just
as pernicious as a rebate in any other way.... No lower
rate should apply on goods imported than actually obtains
on domestic goods from the American seaboard to destination
except in cases where water competition is the
controlling influence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There should be publicity of the accounts of common
carriers.... Books or memoranda should be open to the
inspection of the Government.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The best possible regulation of rates would, of course,
be that regulation secured by honest agreement among the
railroads themselves to carry out the law.... The power
vested in the Government to put a stop to agreements to
the detriment of the public should, in my judgment, be accompanied
by power to permit, under specified conditions
and careful supervision, agreements clearly in the interest
of the public.... But the vitally important power is the
power to fix a given maximum rate, which, after the lapse
of a reasonable time, goes into full effect, subject to review
by the courts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The President further says: “I urge upon the Congress
the need of providing for expeditious action.... The history
of the cases litigated under the present commerce act
shows that its efficacy has been to a great degree destroyed
by the weapon of delay, almost the most formidable weapon
in the hands of those whose purpose it is to violate the law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A summary of the principal provisions in some of the
rate bills that have been brought before Congress will
illustrate the various methods proposed for the better control
of railroads. The Dolliver Bill provides that, when
the Interstate Commerce Commission, after full hearing
upon complaint, is of the opinion that a rate is unjust,
unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory, it shall fix a just
and reasonable maximum rate to go into effect 30 days
after notice. The power applies to joint rates, fares, and
charges, as well as to those within a railroad system. Broad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>provision is also made to cover the fixing of mileage rates,
car rentals, etc. The Commission may order a carrier to
cease and desist from any regulation and practice found
to be unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory. All
orders are to go into effect 30 days after notice unless the
Commission extends the time to 60 days, or the order has
been suspended or modified either by the Commission or by
decree of a competent court. A penalty of $5,000 for each
day an order is disobeyed, and for each separate offence,
is provided for against any carrier, officer, representative,
or agent who knowingly fails or neglects to obey any order
as aforesaid; and the Commission may also apply to the
Circuit Court for injunction, or other proper process, to
compel obedience. Appeal may be taken to the Supreme
Court. Railroads must give 10 days’ public notice of advances
in rates, and 3 days’ notice of reductions, but the
Commission may in its discretion allow changes on less
notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Foraker Bill, which is understood to be preferred by
the railroads, provides for thorough inspection of books,
records, and transactions of interstate roads by agents of
the Commission; and if any rate is found to be unjust, or
unreasonable, or the carrier “is committing any discriminations
forbidden by law, whether as between shippers,
places, commodities, or otherwise, and whether affected by
means of rates, rebates, classifications, differentials, preferentials,
private cars, switching or terminal charges, elevator
charges, failure to supply shippers equally with cars, or
in any other manner whatsoever, the Commission, if the
carrier will not desist upon due notice, may state the case
to the Attorney-General, who is to bring suit in the circuit
court in any district in which the act complained of, or
part of it, was committed, and the court shall summarily
handle the case and enjoin such rate or conduct as it finds
unlawful or what is in excess of what is reasonable and
just.” Appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court. The Bill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>authorizes agreements between railroads in respect to rates
or charges and their maintenance so long as the agreement
is not in <em>unreasonable</em> restraint of trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>The provisions for inspection and combination seem to
us eminently just and useful, although the latter is strenuously
opposed by many on the ground that it authorizes
and invites all the railroads of the United States to form a
huge trust and monopoly to fix rates for the whole country.
This, it is claimed by ex-Senator Chandler, “gives away
all that has been gained by the Supreme Court decisions in
the cases of the Trans-Missouri Freight Association, the
Joint Traffic Association, and the Northern Securities Company.
In the Joint Traffic Association case the nine railroad
systems between New York and Chicago formed an
organization of three billions of capital, made all the rates,
and prohibited any one of the roads from lowering any rate
without the consent of the nine managers of the trust. The
court destroyed this three-billion monster. The Foraker
Bill creates a fourteen-billion monster, which will prevent
any railroad anywhere in the country from lowering any
rates without the consent of the traffic managers of the
combination.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The plan of making the Interstate Commission a mere
investigating body with no power to fix a rate, but only to
state the matter to the Attorney-General, leaving the case
to be tried on his initiative piecemeal in the circuit courts
all over the country, with appeal to the Supreme Court,
seems to us much more objectionable than the permission
to form rate agreements. Under any such form of court
procedure it will be possible for the railroads to delay final
decision, fixing of a just rate, or abolition of an unjust
practice for years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senator Elkins’ plan is substantially the same, his idea
being to give the Commission no real power over rates, but
only the right of petition for judicial action. And suits
may be brought in the Federal courts of every district
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>through which the lines of the carrier in fault are operated,
with appeal on every suit to the Supreme Court of the
United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Hearst has introduced a hill to bring the pipe lines
carrying oil within the Interstate Act and subject them to
the jurisdiction of the Commission; and another bill enabling
the Commission to fix a rate, not merely a maximum
rate, but the actual rate that is to be used in place of any
rate found unreasonable or unjust. The order to take effect
after 30 days. A special court of interstate commerce is
provided for, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review
the orders of the Commission, and suspend, annul, or
enforce such orders, with an appeal to the Supreme Court
only on questions of constitutional law. These are admirable
measures in many ways, but are probably too radical
for passage through the Senate, in which railroad interests
have so large a representation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the other bills the most important are the Esch-Townsend
Bill, the Interstate Commission’s Bill, and the
Hepburn Bill. The Esch-Townsend Bill was intended to
give the Interstate Commission full power to fix a specific
rate, either single or joint, in place of a rate found to be
unreasonable or unjust, and to establish a special court of
transportation to have exclusive original jurisdiction of all
suits to enforce or prevent the enforcement of orders issued
by the Commission under the act.<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c012'><sup>[381]</sup></a> Last year this Bill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>was regarded as the most important measure before Congress,
but this year, 1906, it has been superseded by the
Hepburn Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main points of the Commission’s Bill are: 1. That
power be granted the Commission, after full hearing, to fix
the rate or practice to be observed in the future in place of
the rate or practice found by the Commission to be unreasonable
or unjust.<a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c012'><sup>[382]</sup></a> 2. That the Commission shall have
authority to prescribe the form in which railway books
shall be kept, with the right to examine such books at any
and all times.<a id='r383'></a><a href='#f383' class='c012'><sup>[383]</sup></a> 3. That private car-lines, industrial railroads,
import and export rates, etc., shall be brought within
the scope of the Commission’s power. 4. That the time of
notice of tariff changes shall be extended to 60 days, subject
to modification in the discretion of the Commission,
and the Commission says: “We think that 60 days is
not too long in the great majority of cases, and that such
length of notice would add greatly to the stability of
rates.” 5. That the Commission shall have authority to
order railways to continue through routes and joint rates
and to prescribe the divisions which the several carriers
shall receive in the distribution of those rates in case they
fail to agree among themselves. At present “carriers are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>under no legal obligations to establish through routes or
joint rates, and may at their pleasure withdraw from such
arrangements when they have been actually entered into,”
so that “if the Commission were to pronounce a joint rate
unreasonable and order a reduction of that rate and the
carriers parties to the rate should thereupon either cancel
all joint arrangements, or, as they might, cancel their joint
rates upon the commodity in question, the Commission
would be practically powerless to enforce the reduced rate.
When it is considered that a large part of the most important
rates of this country are joint rates, it will be seen
that the railways have it in their discretion by this means
to largely defeat the purpose of the law.”<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c012'><sup>[384]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Hepburn Bill, which is one of the strongest measures
before Congress, provides that the Interstate Commission,
on complaint and proof that any railway rates
or charges, or any regulations or practices affecting such
rates are unjust, or unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory,
or unduly preferential or prejudicial, may determine and
prescribe what will, <em>in its judgment</em>,<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c012'><sup>[385]</sup></a> be the just and
reasonable rate or charge, which shall thereafter be observed
as the maximum in such case; and what regulation
or practice in respect to such transportation is just,
fair, and reasonable to be thereafter followed. The order
is to go into effect thirty days after notice to the carrier.
And any company, officer, or agent, receiver, trustee, or
lessee who knowingly fails and neglects to obey any such
order is liable to a penalty of $5,000 for each offence; and
in case of a continuing violation each day is to be deemed
a separate offence. It is provided that the Commission
may establish maximum joint rates or through rates as
well as rates pertaining to a single company, and may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>adjust the division of such joint rates if the companies
fail to agree among themselves. The Commission may
also determine what is a reasonable maximum charge for
the use of private cars and other instrumentalities and
services, such as the switching services of terminal railways,
etc. No change is to be made in any rate except
after thirty days’ notice to the Commission, unless the
Commission for good cause shown allows changes upon
shorter notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Commission may petition the Circuit Court to enforce
any order the railroads do not obey. And if on hearing
“it appears that the <em>order</em> was <em>regularly made and duly
served</em>, and that the carrier is in disobedience of the same,
the <em>court shall enforce</em> obedience to such order by a writ
of injunction, or other proper process, mandatory or otherwise,
to restrain such carrier, its officers, agents, or representatives,
from further disobedience of such order, or to
enjoin upon it or them obedience to the same.” Appeal
may be taken by either party to the Supreme Court of the
United States. The Commission may in its discretion prescribe
the forms of all accounts, records, and memoranda to
be kept by the railways, and provision is made for inspection
as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Commission shall at all times have access to all
accounts, records, and memoranda kept by carriers subject
to this Act, and it shall be unlawful for such carriers to
keep any other accounts, records, or memoranda than those
prescribed or approved by the Commission, and it may employ
special agents or examiners, who shall have authority
under the order of the Commission to inspect and examine
any and all accounts, records, and memoranda kept by such
carriers.”<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c012'><sup>[386]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>We are heartily in favor of the Hepburn Bill and would
be glad to see far stronger regulative measures passed,
but nothing more than a moderate palliation of the railway
evils under which we suffer must be expected from
such legislation. England with her rigid control has not
been able to stamp out railroad abuses, and the lesson of
English railroad regulation is that the subjecting of private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>railways to a public control strong enough to accomplish
any substantial elimination of discrimination and extortion
takes the life out of private railway enterprise along with
its evils. Even Germany, with all the power its great government
was compelled to exert, could not eliminate unjust
discrimination until it nationalized the railways, and
so destroyed the root of the evil which lies in the antagonism
of interest between the public, on the one hand, and
owners of the railways and associated industries on the
other.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be noted that none of the plans suggested proposes
to give the Commission any general power to initiate or
originate rates, but only the power of fixing a rate in place
of one found unjust or unreasonable. So that if the railroads
obeyed the law and made no unreasonable rates or
unjust discriminations they would still have the whole rate-making
power in their own hands and the Commission
would have nothing whatever to do with fixing railroad
rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us now examine briefly the merits of the leading
remedies proposed.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><em>Pooling.</em></h3>

<p class='c014'>Many railroad men have advocated the legalization of
pooling and combination as a remedy for discrimination.
A number of railway presidents and managers have told
me they believed this would stop discrimination, and that
nothing else would. Others have assured me that pooling
could not stop discrimination, and even those most emphatic
at the start in the opinion that pooling is the needful
remedy have admitted on further questioning that pooling
would only stop one class of discrimination. Take for example
the statement of the president of one of the greatest
railroad systems in the country who is a strong advocate of
the legalization of pooling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you think unjust discrimination can be
stopped?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>“Give the railroads a right to pool,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will pooling stop discriminations accorded to business
concerns in which the railways or their managers are
interested?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will it stop any kind of discrimination except those
that grow out of competition among the railroads?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I guess not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To another railroad man of wide experience in inter-railway
contracts, I said: “Can any pool prevent the owners
of big concerns in oil, beef, grain, steel, etc., from getting
special advantages, or abolish discrimination in the supply
of cars, quickness of carriage, division of rates, classification,
long and short haul, passes, political favors, and other
forms of favoritism originating in causes independent of
competition among the railroads?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, of course it cannot,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such questions never fail to bring an admission that pooling
cannot be relied on for the whole of the work to be
done in this field. In fact only one of the six motives for
discrimination<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c012'><sup>[387]</sup></a> arises from the competitive conditions
that pooling is expected to remove. Combined roads will
make discriminative rates to create new business, to solidify
traffic, to favor places or concerns in which they are interested,
to favor persons of large influence who may aid or
injure railroad interests, or to injure persons or places
that have incurred their displeasure. All but 2 of the 64
methods of discrimination above enumerated would find
a use under a pooling system or even if combination
were complete and competition entirely done away with,
as the reader may see for himself by running over the list
on pages 229–232.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even competitive discrimination is not eliminated by
pooling, for the railroads will not stick to the pool. A
railroad president has been known to go from the room in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>which he had agreed with other railroad potentates to pool
their business and maintain rates, and hunt up at once a
big shipper, offer him a cut rate, and get a contract taking
the whole of his business away from the other roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Albert Fink, the greatest traffic association organizer we
have had, complained bitterly that rates agreed upon in a
convention were frequently cut before the convention had
dispersed.<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c012'><sup>[388]</sup></a> President Tuttle of the Boston and Maine
says: “I never knew a pooling arrangement that prevented
competition or was wholly satisfactory. There was never
what was considered an equitable distribution of traffic to
anybody, because the strong lines that could control and
handle 50 percent of the traffic were always struggling
against parting with any of that 50 percent, while the
weak, 10 percent road was always trying to get 15 percent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man who drew the first pooling contract made in
this country and has drawn many since says that pooling
will not stop even competitive discrimination, because the
roads will slash rates on the sly to get business. In other
words pooling does not eliminate the struggle for traffic.
Company A has 25 percent of the pool money between
certain points. It cuts rates on the quiet and gets 30 or
35 percent of the business, and then says: “Gentlemen,
I’m carrying 35 percent of the traffic and I want more of
the pool money.” The gentleman just mentioned told me
that this sort of thing had been done in every case of
pooling with which he was acquainted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes the break in the rates is known to the Association
but assented to or tolerated because it is clear that
a break is bound to occur anyway, and may be enlarged
rather than diminished by resistance. Some years ago
when Chauncey Depew was president of the New York
Central system, he said: “Large shippers arbitrarily transfer
the whole of their business from one line to another.
That leaves a weak line denuded of its business.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“A weak line is a line which is dependent largely upon
through traffic and which has not much local business.
These great shippers who control anywhere from ten to
twenty-five cars a day will take all their business off this
weak line and put it on the strongest line, which already
has all it can do.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then the weak line is in trouble, and it comes to these
shippers and says: ‘Well, how can we get you back?’
The shippers say: ‘You can only get us back by giving us
five or ten cents a hundred off from the tariff.’ The weak
line invariably does it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Mr. Depew gave an instance of “one of the great
merchants of the West” who, on the organization of the
Joint Traffic Association, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never have paid within twenty-five cents a hundred
of tariff rates, and I won’t do it now.” “His business,”
continued Mr. Depew, “was on what we call one of the
weak lines. He took it off that line and put it on one of
the strongest lines. That left the weak line without any
westbound business.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then the weak line said: ‘We have got to have business.’
So we simply closed our eyes while the weak line
gave a rate twenty-five cents a hundred less than the rest
of us charged, and this firm advanced while the others
were stationary or went out of business. This firm advanced
by leaps and bounds to the front rank and toward
the control of the business.” If all the roads in the field
do not come into the pool there is every temptation for the
outsider to cut rates. For example, in 1896 one of the
trunk lines outside of the Joint Traffic Association was
carrying grain from Chicago to the seaboard at 13 cents
per hundred when the established tariff, which the Association
was supposed to be maintaining, was 20 cents.<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c012'><sup>[389]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The whole history of the traffic associations shows that
discriminations can be guarded against by pooling only to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>a very limited extent.<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c012'><sup>[390]</sup></a> The legalization of pooling would
enable railroads that wished to insist on the maintenance
of rates to bring suit against roads disregarding the agreement.
This would make it harder to get all the railroads
into a pool, for part of the inducement is the impunity
with which the agreement may be shuffled off, while on the
other hand the degree of respect manifested by the railroads
for the law does not justify much hope that it would be
effective in holding them to any pooling contract if they
thought they could make more by breaking it than by
keeping it. The fact is that the railroads understand each
other now about as well as if pooling were legalized. They
constantly make rate agreements and have no hesitation in
securing whatever degree of unity they desire with or without
law. Pools at best do not apply to local traffic, but
only to business between competing points, so that all discriminations
in local traffic are left absolutely untouched.
And as to competitive points, pooling is far less effective
than consolidation, and consolidation has shown no
tendency to do away with any more than one of the six
classes of discrimination, while it emphasizes and extends
the discriminations in favor of the great industrial interests
whose ownership is interlocked with that of the big railroad
systems, so that the advance of consolidation means
the extension of the influence of the giant industrials in
whose favor the most grievous discriminations are granted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pooling and combination are good in many ways,<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c012'><sup>[391]</sup></a> and
ought to be legalized;<a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c012'><sup>[392]</sup></a> but they cannot be relied on to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>abolish discrimination,—they leave the worst forms untouched,
intensify some of them, and diminish only one
of the six classes of preference. Shippers have a strong
prejudice against pooling, and the railroads do not care so
much about it as they used to, for consolidation and mutual
understanding have enabled them to accomplish in part the
purposes they had in view in the traffic agreements of earlier
years.<a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c012'><sup>[393]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c013'><em>Wrestling with the Long-Haul Abuse.</em></h3>

<p class='c014'>In respect to the long and short haul abuse, Commissioner
Fifer, Brooks Adams, and others argue that the
practical remedy is to make the long-haul clause of the
Commerce Act binding except where the railroads come
in and get an order releasing them to a specified extent
from the operation of the clause.<a id='r394'></a><a href='#f394' class='c012'><sup>[394]</sup></a> The idea is to put the
burden of showing the need of an exception on the railroad.
At present the burden really rests on the complainant. The
railroads disregard the law with impunity. It is easy to
show dissimilar circumstances, and then it is necessary for
the plaintiff to show that the circumstances are not so dissimilar
as to warrant the discrimination made. It is very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>difficult to satisfy a court on this point, and so the rates
stand and the clause is practically nullified. Forbid departure
from the clause absolutely unless the carrier has
obtained an order of release, and you put the burden of
proof where it should lie, namely, on the party that desires
to depart from the rule of equal treatment.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><em>A Drastic Cure for Rebating.</em></h3>

<p class='c014'>For the cure of discrimination, the Transportation Committee
of the New York Board of Trade suggests that
Congress enact a law authorizing the Interstate Commission,
in case of any rebate or other device for securing low
rates, to declare that the net rate so made by the railway
or car owners shall be the regular tariff rate, published as
such, and open to all shippers; said new rate to take effect
immediately, subject to appeal within 60 days upon questions
of law.<a id='r395'></a><a href='#f395' class='c012'><sup>[395]</sup></a> The Committee says the proposal is based
on the plan suggested by “Albert Fink, the ablest of all
American railroad managers,” and adopted by the joint
executive committee of the associated railroads in 1882.<a id='r396'></a><a href='#f396' class='c012'><sup>[396]</sup></a>
“The giving of unlawful rebates by traffic agents would be
preventable if the agent felt assured that such acts would
be followed by his dismissal, and the officers of the company
would find a way to remove an offending agent or to bring
him under control if a punishment of suitable severity were
certain to be imposed upon the road for the violation of the
law against the giving of rebates.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This would indeed be a drastic remedy, and very effective
for the prevention of the discovery of discrimination. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>association of railroads might ferret out preferences under
such a rule, but it would be almost impossible for a public
board to do it. It has been for the most part, as we have
seen, practically impossible for the Commission to get evidence
of specific facts of discrimination, even under the
comparatively mild laws they have tried to enforce. And
under such a law the difficulty would be increased tenfold.
Moreover, if discrimination were discovered and the rule
proposed were put in action, discriminations would thereby
be crystallized and legalized, and great disturbances produced
in the business of railroads and of the community.
Suppose it were discovered that a certain shipper of wheat
from Chicago east had a 10 cent rate over the Erie, while
the published rate on all the lines was 15 cents. Immediately
the 10 cent rate would be open to all shippers over
the Erie. The Erie might be stricken with a sudden
dearth of cars, and be unable to handle the traffic at
all. It would pay the other roads to arrange with the
Erie to be stricken that way. For if the Erie handled
the traffic, the other roads would have to come down to
10 cents and suffer a severe loss, or lose the business and
suffer a severe loss that way. Moreover, the difference in
rates on wheat and flour and other commodities would constitute
serious discrimination, petrified and perpetuated by
law. Again, if many cut rates were discovered in various
lines of business and various degrees of discount, the whole
tariff would be thrown into confusion worse than the normal
chaos. Rates not in the discovered list would have to
be raised to save the revenues of the roads, the long and
short haul rule would go to the winds, and bankruptcy
would threaten not only the culprit railroads but individuals
and communities not conditioned so as to be favored
by the cut-rate lists. On the other hand, if the railroads
tried to be good, the pressure of the big shippers for concessions
would put many roads to serious inconvenience
and threaten them with dangers and losses almost as great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>as those accompanying disobedience, and far more immediate
and certain. Under such circumstances the temptation
to secure secrecy at any cost, and if need be to control
the Commission and the courts, would be irresistible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of those who favor further control of railroads advocate
milder methods. The favorite remedies are public
inspection and the fixing of rates by a commission or court
of arbitration or tariff revision. The facts above stated
showing the secrecy of many forms of preference and the
difficulties of enforcing the law because of the impossibility
of getting railroad officers to reveal the facts indicate the
necessity of systematic and thorough public inspection, but
also suggest a doubt as to its effectiveness. If railroad
officers destroy their papers and refuse to state the facts on
the witness stand, is it not possible that they will keep any
record of discrimination practices from appearing in the
books and papers they submit to inspection? Inspection
and publicity are excellent aids to reform, but they are
insufficient in themselves. We have had already a small-sized
ocean of publicity through the investigations of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, but the results have been
very small.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>FIXING RATES BY PUBLIC AUTHORITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>For years the Interstate Commerce Commission has been
declaring that when, on complaint and investigation it finds
a rate to be unreasonable, it ought to have power to fix a
reasonable rate to take the place of the unreasonable one,
the order to be binding on the railroad for a moderate
period, subject to revision in the courts. For the first
ten years after the Interstate Commerce Act was passed no
railroad denied the right of the Commission to fix rates,
and the Commission says it was supposed that they possess
the power. But the Supreme Court finally ejected this
impression in 1896, and again in 1897, and the Commission
appealed to Congress for the restoration of the authority
that was swept away by the interpretation of the majority
of the Court. Congress for a long time paid no attention
to the Commission’s request for further powers, but President
Roosevelt took up the matter and pushed it with the
splendid vigor that characterizes all he does. In his message
of 1904, already referred to, he said: “Above all
else, we must strive to keep the highways of commerce
open to all on equal terms; and to do this it is necessary
to put a complete stop to all rebates. Whether the shipper
or the railroad is to blame makes no difference; the rebate
must be stopped, the abuses of the private car and private
terminal-track and side-track systems must be stopped, and
legislation of the Fifty-eighth Congress, which declares it
to be unlawful for any person or corporation to offer, grant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>give, solicit, accept, or receive any rebate, concession, or
discrimination in respect of the transportation of any property
in interstate or foreign commerce whereby such property
shall by any device whatever be transported at a less
rate than that named in the tariffs published by the carrier,
must be enforced.... The Government must in increasing
degree supervise and regulate the workings of the railways
engaged in interstate commerce; and such increased supervision
is the only alternative to an increase of the present
evils on the one hand or a still more radical policy on the
other. In my judgment the most important legislative act
now needed as regards the regulation of corporations is this
act to confer on the Interstate Commerce Commission the
power to revise rates and regulations, the revised rate to at
once go into effect, and to stay in effect unless and until
the court of review reverses it.” The President’s message
of December, 1905, has already been quoted at sufficient
length in Chapter XXXII.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the last two years the legislatures of 18 States have
passed joint resolutions petitioning Congress to enact legislation
for the regulation of railroad rates; 12 States took
this action last winter, 1905, and asked their representatives
and senators to secure the enactment of such a measure.
Commercial bodies in various parts of the country have also
petitioned for such legislation, while others have protested
against it.<a id='r397'></a><a href='#f397' class='c012'><sup>[397]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Esch-Townsend Bill (1905) giving the Commission
power to fix rates passed the House, but failed to pass the
Senate.<a id='r398'></a><a href='#f398' class='c012'><sup>[398]</sup></a> As stated in the preceding chapter, the House
has passed the Hepburn Bill by a very large majority and
it has gone to the Senate, where a determined effort will
undoubtedly be made to secure at least a provision for judicial
review on their merits of all orders of the Commission.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><em>Objections of Railroad Men.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Railroad men object to further regulation till the effectiveness
of the present laws has been thoroughly tested. In
answer to the question what he would do to stop discrimination,
President Tuttle of the Boston and Maine Railroad
said to me this morning: “Enforce existing laws. The
Interstate Commission can investigate the railroads. It
need not wait for complaints. It can act on its own initiative.
It can have experts examine the railroad books. It
can publish the facts, and publicity is a powerful corrective.
It can put the facts it secures in the hands of the Attorney-General,
and if the Department of Justice will prosecute
promptly discrimination can be stopped. There were no
prosecutions even after the Hutchinson salt investigation.
The law is ample. The trouble is that no adequate effort
has been made to enforce it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Commission says that as a rule it cannot get the
facts. In some cases it has succeeded, but usually it is
thwarted in respect to personal discriminations (to which
President Tuttle’s argument chiefly applies) because they
are secret, and neither railroad men nor the favored shippers
will ordinarily tell the truth about them, and railroad
books do not commonly contain any record of them.<a id='r399'></a><a href='#f399' class='c012'><sup>[399]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Where the Commission has obtained evidence of unlawful
discrimination it has turned the facts over to the Department
of Justice, which has not prosecuted promptly, in
many cases not at all, and has sometimes prevented prosecutions
which United States district attorneys were ready
to begin.</p>

<p class='c007'>There seems to be good reason to believe it is true that
existing laws have not been fully enforced; that in addition
to the difficulty, perhaps impossibility, of getting at
the facts in many cases, wrongdoers have escaped punishment
even where the facts were fully known; and that
a commission to investigate the Department of Justice, and
try the effect of publicity there, may be as essential as a
commission to investigate the railroads. Some criticism
seems to attach also to the Interstate Commission, as it
does not appear that they have asked the Department of
Justice to prosecute senators and congressmen, legislators,
judges, etc., well known to be riding on passes, nor to
punish the railroads for giving them.</p>

<p class='c007'>As long as express companies and water carriers are not
within the Interstate Act, and doubt exists as to private
cars and terminal railroads, there is room for further legislation.
And in respect to excessive rates and tariff discriminations
between places and commodities, though the
facts can be easily ascertained, the remedy is regarded by
the Commission as wholly inadequate under existing laws,
because of the emasculation of the long and short haul
clause by the interpretation given it by the Supreme Court,
and because the railroads are able, whenever they choose,
to delay the enforcement of an order for years by litigation,
conceding at last perhaps only a small part of what they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>should concede and so requiring further years of contest to
approach another step toward justice. So the Commission
asks for power to fix a reasonable rate in place of one
found unreasonable, and to put the new rate into effect at
once subject to subsequent revision on appeal by the
carrier.</p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads seriously object, first, to the fixing of their
rates by anybody but themselves, and second, to the putting
of such rates into effect before they are tested in court.
The immediate enforcement of a rate order is most strenuously
opposed, and with much force of reason. The railroad
people say that rate-making is very difficult and many
mistakes are likely to be made. Railroad history certainly
affords ample ground for this conclusion. But they say, or
imply, that the Commission makes more mistakes than they
do. They declare that only trained traffic experts can deal
successfully with rate questions; that the Commission has
made so many errors that almost every one of its decisions
that has gone to the courts has been overruled; and that
great havoc would have been wrought if these decisions had
been put into effect at once without judicial review. “Take
for example, the Maximum Rate Case where the Commission
ordered the rates from Cincinnati to important Southern
points cut down 15 or 20 percent. This change in rates to
the basing-points would have affected two or three thousand
rates. Some of the railroads didn’t have a margin of
more than 15 or 20 percent and they determined to fight
the case. It is true that the Commission exercised the
power to fix rates a number of times in the first ten years,
but the cases were comparatively insignificant and the railroads
said, ‘Oh, well, let it go. We’ll take the rate the
Commission wants.’ But when it came to the Cincinnati
case the situation was serious and the railroads said,
‘These fellows haven’t got the power to make rates. In
the debates on the Commerce Bill in Congress it was distinctly
declared that no such power was intended to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>given. We’ll take the question to the courts.’ And the
courts sustained the railroads. Now what would have been
the consequence if the Commission could have put its order
into effect at once? The railroads would have been subjected
to serious losses during all the time that might
elapse before they could get a decision reversing the order
of the Commission. It often takes years to get a final
judgment and there would be no way for the railroads to
recover for the losses entailed by erroneous orders.” This
is the argument substantially as presented to me by President
Tuttle and there is great weight in it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><em>Alleged Errors of the Commission.</em></h3>

<p class='c014'>Another railroad president turns the lime-light of mathematical
analysis on the errors of the Commission. David
Willcox, President of the Delaware and Hudson, says:
“About 93 percent of the decisions of the Commission
which have been passed upon by the courts have been held
to be erroneous. In case, therefore, the Commission had
the future rate-fixing power, so far as its decisions were in
force until the courts passed upon them, injustice would be
accomplished in 93 percent of the cases. For this there
would be no remedy, because no recovery could be had
from those whose goods had been carried at unjustly low
rates.”<a id='r400'></a><a href='#f400' class='c012'><sup>[400]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>We shall see that this statement gives too strong an
impression of the capacity of the Commission for mistakes,
but there is no doubt that it has made mistakes, that any
person or persons attempting to fix rates, even the railroad
managers themselves, are liable to make mistakes, and that
losses result to the roads from their own mistakes and
might naturally result from the mistakes of a commission
or court if its erroneous orders were enforced upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be said that if the orders of the Commission went
into force immediately it would be the interest of the railroads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>to hasten the proceedings in court instead of prolonging
them indefinitely as they are too apt to do, and that
with reasonable provisions for prompt adjudication and the
stimulus of powerful railroad interests in that direction,
the delay of the law, or this branch of it, at least, would
vanish. It may also be said that the railroads could recoup
themselves for the losses under discussion by curtailing the
service they render for the new rates, or by raising other
rates not fixed by the Commission. But the Commission
might veto the raising of other rates, and the entailment of
service would be very undesirable. The question arises
whether it would not be fair for the public to stand any
loss clearly resulting from an improper order of its Commission,
or else require that any order the validity of which
is questioned should be passed upon by the court before it
is put into effect? The Commission is itself perhaps a
sufficient court in respect to questions of fact, and if it
were arranged that in case of dispute on a question of law
the Commission might call upon the Supreme Court for an
immediate interpretation of the law, the rulings of the
Commission could be squared with the law at the start,
and the danger of loss from an erroneous order would be
reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p class='c007'>As above remarked, the mistakes of the Commission
have not been so vast as the reader might infer from the
percentage of overruled cases stated by President Willcox.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work of the Commission may be summarized as
follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>It has received about 3,726 informal complaints relating
to overcharges, classification, rates, etc. Most of
these, perhaps 3,200, have been disposed of by correspondence
or some mild form of arbitration, very many have
been settled satisfactorily, some have been abandoned, and
some have crystallized into formal complaints. The total
number of formal complaints has been about 854, including
those that were formal at the start and those that started
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>as informal complaints and grew to be formal through
failure of adjustment by conciliatory methods. “From
1887 to October, 1904, the Commission rendered 297 decisions
involving 353 cases, two or more cases being heard
and decided together in some instances. About 55 percent,
or 194, of the decisions were in favor of the complainant
and 45 percent in favor of the railroads.<a id='r401'></a><a href='#f401' class='c012'><sup>[401]</sup></a> Mandatory
orders were issued to the number of 170. Of these 94
were complied with by the railroads, 55 were disobeyed,
and 21 were partly complied with and partly disregarded.
Some 43 suits were instituted to enforce the orders of the
Commission; and 34 of these have been finally adjudicated.”
The Commission claims that 8 cases of excessive
rates and unjust discrimination have been decided in its
favor, while President Willcox says that the courts have
sustained the Commission on the merits in only 3 cases.<a id='r402'></a><a href='#f402' class='c012'><sup>[402]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Mr. H. T. Newcomb, who appeared before the Senate Committee
as the representative of several railroads, gives a
table showing that in the circuit courts the Commission
has been sustained 7 times and reversed 24 times, the Circuit
Court of Appeals has sustained the Commission 4½
times and reversed it 11½ times and the United States
Supreme Court has partly sustained the Commission in
one case and reversed it in 15.<a id='r403'></a><a href='#f403' class='c012'><sup>[403]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Several comments are necessary. First, about ⅘ of the
Commission’s decisions have been right on the railroad’s
own showing. They claim only 32 reversals out of 170
orders—nearly all the rest have been accepted by the railroads
or enforced upon them by the courts. Second, the
reversals have been based on questions of law in respect to
which the courts disagreed among themselves. The Commission
has not been overruled in respect to questions of
fact, but on the application of what it believed to be law
(and what the framers of the law believed to be law) to
the removal of economic abuses. Third, the points of law
in respect to which it has been overruled are very few.
The decisions have gone in bunches. For instance while
the Alabama Midland long and short haul case was pending
in the courts a number of other long-haul cases were decided
by the Commission, and when, after several years, the Supreme
Court gave final judgment, a whole block of the
Commission’s rulings on this point were discredited and
subsequent reversals were simply repetitions involving no
new error. So the question of power to fix rates covers a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>cluster of cases all thrown down in reality by one ruling.<a id='r404'></a><a href='#f404' class='c012'><sup>[404]</sup></a>
And these two questions represent nearly the whole difference
between the courts and the Commission. The 15 reversals
in the Supreme Court do not mean 15 errors, even
in respect to legal points, but only a very few errors if any.
Fourth, the higher court reversed the lower in 9 out of the
17 cases that went up from the Circuit Court, and in three
of these cases the Supreme Court reversed both the Circuit
Court and the Court of Appeals. Fifth, it is by no means
certain that the Commission was wrong and the court
right. The fact is that the Supreme Court has not interpreted
the law according to its manifest and well-known
intent, but in a narrow, technical way that has defeated in
large part the real purpose of the law. It is an absurdity
to rule that the law is valid and then to decide that the
railroads may escape from the long-haul section by means
of dissimilar circumstances created by themselves. And
many believe it to be an equal absurdity to declare that the
Commission may order the discontinuance, of an excessive
rate or unjust discrimination, but cannot fix a reasonable
rate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take the Kansas oil rate for example. The railroads
at the dictation of the Combine raised the rate, as we have
seen, from 10 to 17 cents. Suppose the Commission had
ordered the roads to cease charging 17 cents, that being
found to be unreasonable. The railroads could appeal and
appeal, and if after several years the case went against
them they could make a rate of 16½ cents. Then a new
investigation could be begun, the Commission could make
a new order, and after years in the courts the rate might
come down another half cent perhaps. And so on; even if
all the decisions went against the railroads it would take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>105 years to reduce the rate to 10 cents again, calculating
on the basis of the average period of 7½ years required for
final litigation. Why not sum up the process in a single
order for the 10 cent rate and if objected to by the railroads
have one judicial contest and finish the business. By
the indirect method of declaring one rate after another to
be unreasonable the Commission has now the power at last
to fix the rate. The proposition to allow it to name a reasonable
rate is only putting in direct, brief, effective form
the power it now has in indirect, diffused, and ineffective
form. The railroads might not act in the way described,
but the point is that they could do so; there is no power
in the law as it stands to-day to compel them to adopt a
reasonable rate within a reasonable time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, consider the predicament Commissioner Prouty
presents.<a id='r405'></a><a href='#f405' class='c012'><sup>[405]</sup></a> If the Commission, considering all the circumstances
including railroad competition, finds that the rates
from certain points to W should not be higher than the
rates to O and orders the railroads to discontinue the discrimination
between the two cities, the court will sustain
the order and grant an injunction to enforce it. But if the
Commission finds that there should be some difference between
the rates to the two places, though not so much
difference as there is, and it orders the rates to W down so
that they will be fair, the courts will annul the order because
the Commission has no power to fix rates in the
opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class='c007'>The railways contend that a relative order would be
sufficient. The Commission could say what percentage
of the Omaha rate the advance for Wichita should be, and
in the Kansas case the rate on oil could be determined in
reference to the rates on other commodities. It is true
that a relative order could be made, but it might be more
embarrassing to the railroads to have a group of rates tied
up by each decision so that they could not vary any of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>them without changing the rest, than it would be to have
one rate definitely fixed; the subtraction from elasticity
might be greater, and the difficulty of determining the true
relations between various rates might be far more serious
than the fixing of a reasonable rate in the particular case.
It would be possible to give the Commission the option to
make a relative order or to definitely fix a reasonable rate
providing that it should carefully consider the preference
of the carrier as to the form of order, the reasons for that
preference, and the guarantee the carrier may be willing to
give as to <em>bona fide</em> compliance with the order, and then
make up its judgment in the light of the circumstances in
such a way as to accomplish the purpose in view with the
greatest certainty and the least friction or interference with
the freedom of railroad management.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the railroads object to the fixing of rates in any
manner by a public board,<a id='r406'></a><a href='#f406' class='c012'><sup>[406]</sup></a> declaring that such a board
could not be in sufficiently close touch with traffic conditions
all over the country to adapt their rulings to the
needs of business, that tariffs would lose the elasticity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>requisite to keep them in harmony with changing economic
conditions. A rate that is reasonable to-day may be unreasonable
to-morrow. It is said that it keeps several hundred
men, 500 to 700 skilled traffic men, working all the time
on the adjustment of rates, and that it is beyond the power of
half a dozen men to pass on the rate question of a country like
this; that Congress cannot delegate to a commission the
power to fix rates; that it would destroy the initiative of
railroads and hurt their power of borrowing money for improvements,
injure investors, and throw the whole railroad
world out of gear; that the centralization of power would
be dangerous, the disturbance of business and interference
with development disastrous, and the practical confiscation
of railroad properties and values unjust; that a flood
of litigation would follow, and that discrimination would
not be removed, for agents hustling for business would
cut under commission-made rates as quickly as they cut
railroad-made rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is much force in some of these points, none at all
in others. There is no reasonable doubt that Congress
can authorize a commission to fix rates. Railway Commissions
in 21 States have power to fix rates, either absolute or
maximum, and some of them have exercised the power vigorously,
and a national commission may be given the same
power over interstate commerce that a State commission
may have over State commerce.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is more force in the objection based on the lack of
elasticity in commission-made rates. Elasticity, however,
may easily be overdone and much of the present elasticity
is very undesirable. Many flying tariffs and unfair discriminations
lurk under cover of that reputable word
elasticity. Moreover the Commission would not interfere
with any fair rate-making by the railroads. The bulk of
the rates would not be touched but only those that were
unjust. So that it would depend entirely on the railroads
how much of the flexibility they so much admire should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>kept in their own hands. They would keep it all unless
they were guilty of dishonest flexibility, in which case the
elasticity, which, according to impartial judgment, exceeded
the bounds of justice, would be checked.</p>

<p class='c007'>In reference to the alleged necessity of flexibility in
tariffs and the ability of traffic managers to accommodate
the rates to fluctuating commercial conditions, Chairman
Knapp of the Interstate Commission says that there need
not be any tendency to iron-clad rules or undue emphasis
of the mileage basis on the part of a Government board,
but that the necessity of frequent changes in tariffs is
greatly overdrawn. He states that the railroads have kept
the same basis of rates since 1887 throughout the most important
part of the United States, the “official classification
territory” or the section north of the Ohio and Potomac
and east of the Mississippi, and that “the class rates which
govern most merchandise and articles of manufacture and
ordinary household consumption have remained unchanged
in all that territory.” The railroads changed the classification
of many articles about 1900, “but they did not change
the rates or the adjustments between localities.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I take it there is no agricultural product the price of
which has shown such wide fluctuations in the last few
years as cotton. It is one of the great staple articles of the
country; the most valuable per pound of anything that
grows out of the ground in large volume. More than half
of it is exported and you know the price has gone from
scarcely above 5 cents to 16 or 17 cents. And if there is any
article which would seem to be susceptible to market fluctuations
and the changes in commercial conditions, it must be
cotton. But an inspection of the tariffs will show you that
the rates on cotton have not been changed in ten years.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There has been no material change, I think, in any
cotton rate in more than ten years, except that certain
reductions have been made in the State of Texas by the
commission of that State.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>“Now, when I observe instances of that kind, when the
ablest and most experienced traffic officials tell me that
there is no sort of reason for 500 to 1,000 changes in interstate
tariffs every twenty-four hours, as our files show there
are, you must not be surprised if I fail to accept at par value
all that is said here about the necessity of adapting rates to
commercial conditions. Undoubtedly, when you take a considerable
period of time, great influences do operate to an
extent which may justly require material modifications in
freight charges, but to my mind it is quite unsuitable that
the little surface fluctuations in trade should find expression
in extended changes in the daily tariffs. I believe
that those surface currents should adjust themselves to the
tariffs, and not the tariffs to the currents. And I am saying
this, gentlemen, not as a result so much from my own
observation or from any <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à priori</span></i> view of the case as because
of the statements made and arguments submitted to me by
practical railroad men of the highest distinction.”<a id='r407'></a><a href='#f407' class='c012'><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To lay stress on the number of men required to arrange
the details of tariffs might seem to imply the belief that
a very large part of existing railroad rates will be found
unreasonable and need the attention of the Commission.
It may however imply merely that there is likely to be a
very large number of complaints. The fact is that the
fixing of rates is a complex business, with a considerable
percentage of guesswork, experiment, broad judgment, and
arbitrary decision. There are some general principles of
cost, distance, what the traffic can pay and move, what
shippers demand, what other carriers are charging, what
rates are necessary to create new business and fill up the
cars both ways, etc., but they are like the principles of law,
you can come to any conclusion you wish and then find a
principle that will back up your decision. Railroad men
do not trouble themselves about consistency. They do not
and cannot adjust rates with reference to just relations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>between places and commodities. They are looking for
dividends and they make the best rates they can with that
object in view. The chief traffic officer of one of the trunk
lines, being pressed by the Commission as to his method of
making rates, said: “We make rates very much as the
honey bee makes its cells, by a sort of instinct.” When we
look at his rates we find that he is not so successful as the
honey bee in respect to symmetry and balance. Another
traffic manager whose skill brings him a salary of $50,000
a year, testifying as to the reasonableness of his grain rates,
was asked question after question as to methods of determination,
till finally he said: “To tell you the truth, gentlemen,
we get all we can.” Now it is because the railroads
know that the Commission would refuse to adopt this time-honored
principle and would aim primarily not at profit to
the railroads, but at just and impartial rates—it is this
knowledge which more than anything else impels the railroads
to such strenuous opposition to any proposal for the
fixing of rates by a public board. The matter is of such
moment that, when I asked one of our leading railroad
presidents what would happen if the rate-making power
were put in the hands of a commission, he said: “The
stake would be so great that the commission would have
to be controlled, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The railroads have the Senate, and the Senate must
confirm all nominations to the Interstate Commission.
Aside from the appointment of Judge Cooley all nominations
to the Commission from 1887 down have been due,
said this railroad president, not to any special fitness for
the work, but to political pull. If a commissioner is
appointed from a certain State, the senators from that
State regard the place as a part of their patronage, and
when the term of his appointment expires they insist on
the nomination of another man from their State. They
say: “The place belongs to our State,” and it is always
their man, a man they want on the board, who is presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>by them for nomination. Vermont for example has had
three members on the Commission in succession, Walker,
Veazie, and Prouty; each time a vacancy has occurred in
the Vermont representation it has been filled at the dictation
of the senators from that State; “even President
Roosevelt did not appoint for fitness. When a vacancy
occurred he did not look for the man best fitted to serve
on such a Commission, but appointed Senator Cockrell
of Missouri, a nice old man of 70 that everybody liked,
but without any special qualification for the work. The
election went to the Republicans in Missouri, so Cockrell
couldn’t go back to the Senate. He has many friends.
The senators all like him, Republicans as well as Democrats,
and they said to Roosevelt: ‘You must do something
for Cockrell; here’s a democratic vacancy on the
Interstate Commission, put him in there,’ and Roosevelt
put him in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This railroad president is a man of the highest character
and of very extensive information. Whether or no he is
rightly informed in respect to the appointment of commissioners,
it is clear that the railroad representation in
the Senate could bring tremendous pressure to bear to
secure the appointment of men approved by railroad interests,
that they could block the appointment of any other
sort of men even if nominated, and that the temptation to
exert this power to secure men who could be controlled
would be practically irresistible if the Commission were
given the rate-making power.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fear of confiscation does not seem to be well
founded on the part of the railroads; there is more to
justify such a fear on the part of companies and localities
unfairly treated by the railroads. The Commission will
have no motive to make confiscatory orders, and the courts
will protect the roads from everything that is doubtful in
the slightest degree as they have done in the past. The
real danger of confiscation of values lies in leaving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>railroads free to make such orders as those in the San
Antonio case or the Kansas oil case which destroyed the
business of independent operators. Adding 25 cents a ton
to the coal rates from San Antonio practically confiscated
the coal mines at that point, and raising the oil rates in
Kansas from 10 to 17 cents practically confiscated, during
the continuation of the order, the product of the independent
oil wells.</p>

<p class='c007'>That some disturbance of tariffs and business might
result from conferring the rate-fixing power on a public
board is quite likely. There is a good deal of business
that ought to be disturbed; that of the Beef Trust and the
Oil Trust for example would be the better for a thorough
house-cleaning. And the tariffs need considerable disturbance
to bring them into close relations with the principles
of justice. But the disturbance <em>might</em> be more than is needful.
Our railroads say that Government boards the world
over show a tendency to adopt some sort of a mileage
basis, in the shape of a zone system or some other form
of distance tariff. This would interfere with the equalization
of rates, which is one of the best elements in
American railroading. The fruits of California are carried
all over the country at low blanket rates that enable them
to be sold in every hamlet in the country at prices the
common people can afford to pay. New England shoes are
carried to St. Louis at 1½ cents a pair and to San Francisco
for 2 cents a pair. Milk is brought into the cities at the
same rate for many miles out. So with the pulp mills in
the forests of New York, Vermont, and Maine. The railroads
give them all equal rates to the great cities. When
the big mill at Millinocket, Me., was being planned the
promoters went to the railroads for rates. To make the
product cheap they must build on a large scale, and to
justify this they must be able to reach many markets;
they must be able to supply newspapers in Boston, New
York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. So the railroads gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>them rates that enabled them to send their paper 1,500
miles to Chicago and sell it to newspapers there at the
same price they would have to pay for paper that came
only 500 miles.<a id='r408'></a><a href='#f408' class='c012'><sup>[408]</sup></a> This destroys nature’s discriminations
due to distance, and places men on an equality in the
market to win by their merits, not by natural advantages
or disadvantages of location. This is in many ways a
beneficent process and if the railways did not create
new artificial discriminations of their own they would be
entitled to be placed among the great equalizers of the age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Years ago there was a vigorous argument about the rates
on wire from Worcester, Mass., to Chicago, and from Pittsburg
to Chicago. The wire mills of Worcester had a good
business, employing some 5,000 men, and marketing mostly
in the West. Mills were built in Pittsburg, and being much
nearer Chicago got a lower rate to that city. The New
York Central at once met the rates so that the Worcester
Mills could get to market on a level with the Pittsburg
people, who still had the advantage of nearness to the coal
and iron mines. Not satisfied with this, however, they carried
the question to the Traffic Association, claiming that
as they were 500 miles nearer Chicago, they should have a
lower freight rate than the Worcester mills. But they
didn’t get it. The New York Central said: “Here are
5,000 men at work in Worcester. What are they going to
do if we let you crowd them out of Chicago, which is their
principal market? We shall stand by them and meet any
rate you make from Pittsburg.” That was fine, as good
as the raising of a rate to kill the San Antonio mine was
bad; the railroads can save industrial life as well as commit
industrial murder.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said that government rate-fixing would not meet
such cases; that the principle of equalization is not recognized,
and both justice and business development would
suffer thereby.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>It is not true that government rate-fixers do not recognize
the equalization principle. The national post-office
has carried it to the limit, and has based its business upon
it to such an extent that it is known as the post-office principle.
It is applied in government telegraph and telephone
systems much more fully than in our private systems.
Even the State railways make considerable use of it.
Although the tendency is to adopt some sort of distance
system as the main basis of the tariff, there is constant
recognition in Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland,
and the Australasian States, and it is announced as a definite
policy that so far as reasonably possible rival industries
shall be placed on an equality in the market. “We mean
to bring the manufacturer who is 100 miles away into the
market on a level with the man who is 10 miles away,”
said the manager of one of these government systems to
me, and there is more or less of the same spirit and purpose
in all the government systems I am acquainted with.
The fact is that a movement toward the equalization of
rates through application of the principle to one commodity
after another, or the gradual extension of zone distances
in a zone tariff, offers the only hope of attaining a really
just and scientific system of rates. Any sudden adoption
of such a system would disturb the values of real estate, etc.,
beyond all reason, but it can be gradually approached, and
that is what the railroads in this and other countries are
doing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our Interstate Commission has, I believe, shown too
little appreciation of this fact, too much tendency to insist
that a town or city is entitled to the benefit of its geographical
position. It is entitled to the benefit of its geographical
position to the extent that no place more distant from
its market should have lower rates to and from that market,
but the right to claim that the rates shall not be equal
is very questionable, and frequently it is clear that no such
right exists. The Commission has recognized this point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>in several cases. For example, in the Business Men’s
Association of St. Louis <em>v.</em> the Santa Fe, Northern Pacific,
Union Pacific, and other roads,<a id='r409'></a><a href='#f409' class='c012'><sup>[409]</sup></a> the Commission sustained
a blanket rate on many commodities from the Pacific Coast
to all points east of the Missouri River. And in the Orange
Rate Case<a id='r410'></a><a href='#f410' class='c012'><sup>[410]</sup></a> decided last year, a blanket rate of $1 per
hundred on lemons from Southern California to all points
east of the Missouri was approved. In the milk case, however,
it held that “A blanket rate on milk on all the Delaware,
Lackawanna’s lines, New Haven road, Reading,
Erie, New York Central, and West Shore and other roads
regardless of distance, viz., 32 cents on milk and 50 cents
on cream per can of 40 quarts, is unjust to producers and
shippers of the nearer points. There should be at least
four divisions of stations,—the first extending 40 miles
from the terminal in New Jersey, the second covering a
distance of 60 miles and ending about 100 miles from such
terminal, and the third covering the next 90 miles, and the
fourth covering stations more than 190 miles from the terminal.
The rates on milk in 40–quart cans should not
exceed 23 cents from the first group of stations, 26 cents
from the second group, 29 cents from the third, and the
present rate of 32 cents from the fourth group.”<a id='r411'></a><a href='#f411' class='c012'><sup>[411]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is quite possible that the Commission made a mistake
in this case, though it is not easy for any but a railroad
man, with a ravenous appetite for tonnage and reckless of
the waste of economic power, to see any sense in arranging
rates so as to take milk to New York from points
near Buffalo while Buffalo gets milk from places east of
points shipping to New York; but if the Commission did
fall into error in this case, the mistake of refusing to allow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>the distant man to come into the metropolitan market on
equal terms with the nearer man is nothing compared to
the mistake the railroads so frequently commit of allowing
some Chicago or Kansas City man to come into New York
at lower rates than the New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
New England producers have to pay.</p>

<p class='c007'>In respect to the distance tariff question, Chairman
Knapp of the Commission says: “I am very far from
believing that there should be anything more than the
most inconsiderable tendency, if any at all, toward the adjustment
of rates on a mileage basis, and I think the
prosperity of the railroads, the development of the different
sections of the country and their industries, justify
the making of rates upon what might be called a commercial
basis rather than any distance basis; but do you
realize what an enormous power that is putting into the
hands of the railroads? That is the power of tearing down
and building up. That is the power which might very
largely control the distribution of industries. And I want
to say in that connection that I think on the whole it is remarkable
that that power has been so slightly abused. But
it is there.... It comes back to the question which
Senator Dolliver asked, are the railroads to be left virtually
free to make such rates as they conceive to be in their interests?
Undoubtedly their interest in large measure and
for the most part is the interest of the communities they
serve. Undoubtedly in large measure and for the most
part they try as honestly and as conscientiously as men can
to make fair adjustments of their charges. But suppose
they do not. Is there not to be any redress for those who
suffer? That is really the question.... Suppose it were
true that a more potent exercise of government authority
and the adjustment of rates tended somewhat to increase
the recognition of distance with the result of producing a
greater diffusion of industry rather than its concentration....
I cannot believe that all those institutions, laws,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>administrations which operate to the concentration of industries
and population are altogether to be commended.
I doubt if they result in happier homes, better lives, greater
social comfort.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A public board might not be willing to apply the equalization
principle without limitation under competitive conditions.
It might put the sash and door makers of Michigan
and Vermont on an equality in New York City, and yet
not think it best to enable the Vermont manufacturers
to send sash to Michigan and Indiana points at the same
rates the Michigan manufacturers pay, while the Michigan
factories get the same rates to Vermont and Massachusetts
points as the Vermont people; nor to arrange matters so
that a train-load of bananas from the port of New York to
Boston would pass a train-load of bananas going from the
port of Boston to New York. It takes a lot of railroads
working for profit, regardless of the waste of industrial
force, to see the wisdom of such cross-hauling. A public
board would be likely to recognize not merely the principles
of profit, equalization, and development of traffic, but
also the principles of economy from a national standpoint,
the adaptation of special localities to special work, the
value of diversification of industry, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is entirely possible to avoid such mistakes as those
attributable to the Commission in its geographical cases,
and other mistakes that may come from lack of thorough
acquaintance with practical transportation problems, by
putting on the Commission two or three traffic men of high
character and long experience in the business of making
rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>And as the business of the Commission would not be to
make rates in the first instance, but only to revise them on
complaint, much as the chief officers of railway departments
do now, only with a public motive and point of view
instead of a private one, there is every reason to believe
that the work of revision could be intrusted to a well-selected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>commission, with great advantage to the public.
The very existence of an effective power of revision ought
to go a long way toward making the use of the power
unnecessary. And it is wholly just and practicable that
monopoly charges should be subject to the veto of a public
board that is in a position to take a broad, disinterested
view of rates and other transportation questions.</p>

<p class='c007'>How superior the Commission’s methods are in many
ways to those in use on our railways can hardly be appreciated
by one who is not familiar with the unscientific,
chaotic rate-making practices everywhere in vogue in this
country, and also with the breadth and system that marks
the work of the Commission.</p>

<p class='c007'>An illustration may help to make the contrast clear.
Take the case of Kindel <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Albany, and other
railroads, decided by the Commission, December 28, 1905.
The railroads were charging $2.24 per hundred on cotton-piece
goods from Boston, New York, and other eastern
points to Denver, and $1.50 on the same goods from the
East clear through to San Francisco. The local rate from
Omaha or Kansas City to Denver was $1.25, the same as
the rate on first-class goods, and the rate from the Atlantic
to Denver was made by adding the said local rate to the
rate from the East to the Missouri River. Kindel complained
that the rate to Denver was unreasonable and
unjust. The Commission carefully studied the facts, took
into consideration the relation between cotton rates and
first-class rates on various routes throughout the country,
put the data on a chart, a facsimile of which accompanies
this description, and came to the conclusion that “the
exaction of first-class rates on cotton-piece goods between
Missouri River points and Denver, in view of the long
prevailing differentials in other parts of the country and
other existing conditions, is unjust and unreasonable; and
that the result of the excessive rate on cotton-piece goods
between the Missouri River and Denver and the application
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>of full locals in making up the through combination
rate from New York, Boston and other eastern points
taking the same rates to Denver is to make the through
rate excessive, and that such through rate to Denver to be
reasonable should not exceed $1.50 per hundred pounds.”<a id='r412'></a><a href='#f412' class='c012'><sup>[412]</sup></a></p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_298.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>If the reader will examine the chart he will see that the
cotton figures (which are placed below the route-lines) are
less than the first-class rates (which are printed above the
route-lines) in every case except between the Missouri
River and Denver, and in some cases the cotton rates
are only half the first-class rates. In view of the practically
universal custom of the railroads in this relation, the
deviation in the case of Denver amounted to a practical
discrimination against that city and any shippers who
desired to lay down cotton goods in Colorado. The railroads
carried the goods from Boston to Chicago for 55
cents, while charging $1.25 from Omaha to Denver, more
than double the charge for half the distance.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>Railroad rate-makers do not base their tariffs on broad
considerations of justice, but get what they can out of the
traffic for their own lines, while the Commission asks what
rate will yield a fair profit, and will be just to the public
and to the individuals and localities involved, considering
all the circumstances and their relation to transportation
conditions throughout the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>At best, however, it cannot be denied that great inconvenience
and some injustice might be inflicted upon the
railroads by public rate revision. It seems to come down
to the choice of the least of two evils. The President and
the people say that if the railroads are left free to make the
rates they do not deal fairly; experience shows that they
discriminate unjustly between persons and places, and put
some rates too high and others too low. The railroads say
that if a public board should make the rates the companies
might not be treated fairly. Both statements are true. But
it is clear that somebody must make the rates. And it is
equally clear that there is no system of rate-making that
will do perfect justice. I know of no railway minister or
traffic manager in Europe or America who even dreams he
knows of any method of rate-making that will do justice
all round under present industrial conditions. The post-office
principle may ultimately be applied to diffuse the
burden of distance over the whole community, but it is not
practicable at present. If then a certain amount of injustice
is unavoidable, and we must choose between injustice
to a small group of stockholders or to eighty millions of
people, which alternative shall we accept? If there is no
way to solve this problem that will not work injustice
somewhere, shall it be to the little group of profit-makers
or to the great public, the people of the United States?</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides this quantitative comparison, there is a qualitative
comparison that is still more weighty. Such injustice
as may be done to the railways is merely a matter of diminished
dividends on stocks, a very large part of which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>water; while the false rates and unfair discriminations
made by the railway managers not only affect property
interests many times greater than railway stocks, but deny
equal opportunity and undermine morals, manhood, government,
civilization, and progress,—values far higher
than any financial items whatever. Moreover, it is not
unlikely that a board constituted somewhat differently
from the present one might eliminate most of the errors
of the Interstate Commission as well as those of the railway.
What are the causes at work in the case? The
reason the Commission has made some injurious rulings
is that they lack the thorough acquaintance with traffic
conditions that the railway managers possess. And the
reason the railway managers make rates that are contrary
to public policy is that they are more or less influenced by
motives that are antagonistic to the public interest. The
Commission is disinterested; it has no wish or personal
interest leading to unfairness either to the railroads or the
public; its motive is right, but its knowledge is imperfect.
The railway traffic managers, on the other hand, have much
more perfect understanding of the transportation business,
but their interest is not altogether in harmony with justice
and the public good. Is it not possible to create a board
that shall have the thorough knowledge of first-class railway
experts, together with the high motives and unmixed
interests of an honorable public commission or court, and
so remove the chief causes that have worked injustice in
the past?</p>

<p class='c007'>It is possible that there may be another fair solution,—that
the rates may be made neither by the railroads themselves
nor by a body representing the public alone. As
there are three partners in the railroad business, as
in every great industry,—viz., labor, capital, and the
public,—it may be regarded as a case for arbitration,
or for decision, not by any one partner alone, but by a
board representing all three partners. Should there not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>be a board on which the railways have a right to representation,
the workers being represented too, and the public
also having fair representation upon the board? Then
the decision would represent the co-ordination of thought
and interest of the three great parties concerned in the
railway problem. Perhaps such a solution would be superior
in its justice to decision either by the railways alone
or by a body representing the public only.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is clear that the final power to pass on transportation
rates must rest somewhere. That railways are public
highways, and transportation charges in the nature of taxes,
are settled principles of law and economics. That governments
have a right to regulate railroad rates is everywhere
recognized. But how is the right to be effectively exercised?
If legislative bodies attempt to exercise it directly,
the lack of detailed information as to specific cases and the
failure of elasticity and adaptation to the needs of business,
urged against Commission work, would be emphasized a
hundred fold. There is no way but to delegate the power to
an expert board, not with the expectation of perfect justice,
but of the greatest attainable justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most important question of all in this connection
remains to be considered, viz., would the possession of the
rate-fixing power enable a regulative board to stop discriminations?
Practically every rate question but one
involves the question of discrimination. The exception is
the query: “Are the total charges unreasonable?” It is
conceivable that the relations of the various rates might be
fair but the whole tariff might be pitched too high or too
low; then the reasonableness of that tariff would be the
only question on which action would be requisite. But in
practice there are always some rates that are low enough,
some too low, and some too high. And there are always
two active questions in reference to any rate: 1. Is it fair
in relation to the rates accorded to other persons, places, or
commodities? 2. Is it reasonable? In other words, is it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>such that if other rates stood in true relations with it the
total margin of profit would yield a fair return and no more
than a fair return on the investment? Both questions are
very difficult, especially the latter. The reasonableness
of each particular rate depends not only on its own individual
circumstances, but on a comparison with all other rates
and a consideration of the company’s entire business. Difficult
as it is, it would seem necessary to try to answer it
in a broad way, at least in respect to the tariff as a whole,
for the failure to answer it may mean unjust taxation of
industry, inflation of capital values, dividends on watered
stock, vast accumulations of wealth in the hands of railway
owners, political corruption, and the whole train of evils
that follow in the wake of industrial aggression. Yet
deeply important as it is to secure reasonable rates, how
futile it would appear to attempt to do it by means of a
board making orders as to this, that, and the other rate
complained of, but without power to revise the tariff as a
whole, or to require any particular standard of service in
return for the rate decided upon. For every cent cut off
the rate by the Commission, the railways, if they are agreed
to act in harmony, can easily withdraw two cents’ worth of
facilities. Suppose the Commission can fix a reasonable
rate, what is the use of it unless it can schedule to its
judgment a minute specification of the quantity and quality
of service to be rendered in return for that rate? And it
would have to schedule also the price level, the crops, and
all the conditions of home and foreign markets and adjust
the rate on a sliding scale, else the rate that is reasonable
now may become very unreasonable in a few weeks or
months from now. And if, instead of this patchwork, the
public board attempts to revise the tariff as a whole and
fix the services to be rendered, it will either get itself captured
by the railroads or it will cripple railroad enterprise.
Railroad men are not going to work with much spirit if
you take the control of rates and service out of their hands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>and if you leave them control of either they will have you
instead of your having them. It always means a struggle
for mastery where a body that does not own seeks to control.
The body that owns and has possession will evade,
pervert, defy if possible, and if overborne will lose initiative
and energy and take on the air of a conquered province.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case is no better in respect to discrimination. In
the first place it is clear that, as railroad managers have
testified, it would be just as easy to cut rates made by a
commission as to disregard the rates made by the railways
and published by them and thereby made obligatory under
the law. Mr. J. H. Hiland, head of the traffic department
of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul, says: “I can cut
a rate or give a rebate on a rate fixed by a commission just
as easily as though I had made the rate myself.”<a id='r413'></a><a href='#f413' class='c012'><sup>[413]</sup></a> Mr.
W. D. Hines, till recently Vice-President of the Louisville
and Nashville, says: “The Townsend Bill made no provision
whatever which looked to the prevention of rebates. It
provided that the Commission should fix rates, but there
would have been the same facilities and the same inducements
to cut the rates made by the Commission as to cut
the rates established by the railroads.”<a id='r414'></a><a href='#f414' class='c012'><sup>[414]</sup></a> President Tuttle
of the Boston and Maine puts the case in this way. “A
big shipper says to the managers of the A, B, &amp; C railroads
‘Give me a cut rate.’ They refuse. Pretty soon all
P’s business is going by the X line. The A, B, &amp; C
folks notice that they are losing traffic and they say ‘Look
here, where’s all that business we used to get? The X
line is getting it all. P’s got a concession over there!’
Maybe he has and maybe he hasn’t, but you can’t make
those fellows on A, B, &amp; C believe that he hasn’t. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>go to P and say: ‘What are you giving all your business
to the X line for?’ P says, ‘Well, I asked you to give
me a lower rate and you wouldn’t do it.’ He don’t say
he’s got a lower rate on X, and maybe he hasn’t, but the
effect on A, B, &amp; C is the same as if he had. They say,
‘What do you want?’ P says, ‘Give me 2 cents a hundred
off the rate and I’ll distribute my business as I did before.’
So they give him 2 cents off and they get the tonnage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. E. P. Vining, a former railroad manager, says that
the reduction of a rate found unreasonable by the Commission
may result in new discriminations unless other rates
are reduced in fair proportion.<a id='r415'></a><a href='#f415' class='c012'><sup>[415]</sup></a> It is also clear that in
many cases the reduction of other rates by the railroads
may nullify the effect of the Commission’s order in respect
to the rate complained of. Take, for example, the railroads
leading from the wheat belt to Minneapolis and to
Milwaukee. Excepting the Chicago, Milwaukee and St.
Paul the roads that lead to Minneapolis are not the same
roads that lead to Milwaukee. The Commission found
that the rates on grain to Milwaukee and Minneapolis subjected
the former to undue prejudice and disadvantage, but
if the Milwaukee roads were ordered to reduce their rates
to a given level the Minneapolis roads could neutralize the
order by reducing their rates below the said level.<a id='r416'></a><a href='#f416' class='c012'><sup>[416]</sup></a> In
other words no mere right to designate a reasonable rate
in place of a rate complained of and found unreasonable can
prevent unfair discrimination between places.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing short of a general rate-making power can do the
work properly. Particular rate-fixing alone means patchwork
and inefficiency, easy evasion and new discriminations
in place of the old ones. On the other hand, to give a
public board general power to revise rates would if effective
be tantamount to taking possession of the railroads without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>compensation, and if ineffective would amount to little
in the way of stopping discrimination. If the tariffs were
made by or subject to the revision or approval of a public
commission and the rates so made were enforced, the most
vital element in the ownership of the roads would be made
public. And if the rates were disregarded or the power
not vigorously and intelligently exercised the evils we are
considering would still continue.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>CAN REGULATION SECURE THE NEEDFUL DOMINANCE OF PUBLIC INTEREST?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is questioned whether any form of regulation can overcome
discriminations. One of the ablest members of the
Interstate Commerce Commission said to me: “No, regulation
can never stop discrimination.” And the man who
is regarded by many as the leading railroad expert in the
country replied to my question in substantially the same
way. “Regulation properly so-called cannot eliminate
discrimination, though it may greatly diminish it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>What he meant was that a control strong enough to
eliminate discrimination, would not be regulation, but ownership
or quasi-ownership. So long as men representing
private interests continue to possess control over rates and
services they will continue to discriminate, for private interests
demand discrimination. And if control of rates or
services or both is placed in a public body, public ownership
or quasi-public ownership is thereby established, for control
is the essence of ownership. It makes little difference
who has the title to a farm if I have the control of it and
can determine the way in which the work shall be done
and the price at which the crops shall be sold. The
“owner” in such case is little more than a mortgagee—he
has the interest on his capital, whatever I choose to
allow him, and that’s all. It would seem that if the
people wish to control the railroads, they should buy them
at a fair value, and not establish complete or quasi-ownership
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>without compensation, under the name of regulation
and control.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is an interesting line of thought, and philosophically
has considerable force in respect to control extending beyond
what the public may have a right to claim as a partner
by reason of the bestowal of franchises and other benefits.
It is also important to note that only substitution of managers
owing allegiance to the public interest in place of
managers representing private interests can eliminate the
motives to discrimination, and remove the antagonism of
interest between the owners and the public, which is the
root of all railroad evils.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is a practical world, however, and the practical facts
are that the difficulties in the way of public ownership of
railways in this country at present are very great, and that
much good may be accomplished by judicious regulation.
The long and short haul clause may be made effective; the
railroads can be prevented from paying shippers more for
cars or switches than they would pay each other; private car-lines,
express companies, and water carriers can be brought
within the Commerce Act; the Commission can be given
power to name a reasonable rate or practice in place of one
found unjust, and either put it in force at once, subject to
revision in a special court devoted to transportation cases,
and acting promptly on all appeals, or themselves take the
facts and their conclusions at once to the court and get a
ruling before putting the order into effect; and railroad
managers can be prohibited from having any interest in any
concern that can be aided by transportation favors over
their roads, as is already the case on James J. Hill’s Great
Northern, except with respect to Mr. Hill himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides all this it may be possible to make the law so
clear that the courts cannot twist it out of shape, and the
States might be got to pass laws in complete harmony with
the Federal statutes. Railroads and trusts can be subjected
to public inspection, and to the pressure of damage suits,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>injunctions, and progressive taxation. If need be the public
could demand representation on the boards of direction of
all the railroads, or the traffic managers could be made
public servants and required, as receivers are now, to report
semi-occasionally to the Federal courts, and to State
courts also, perhaps, with the power of judicial removal in
case of misconduct. There is a practical warrant for demanding
representation in the management of the roads, in
the fact that the franchises bestowed on them by the public
represent a large part, probably half, of their market values.
The public is entitled, as we have said, to be regarded as a
partner in the railroads.</p>

<p class='c007'>If after thorough trial, regulation proves insufficient or
unsatisfactory, public ownership remains.<a id='r417'></a><a href='#f417' class='c012'><sup>[417]</sup></a> The movement
of thought in that direction in the last few years is very
remarkable. In whatever way relief may come, whether
by regulation or public ownership, <em>the essential fact is the
dominance of public interest over private interest at the points
where private departs from public interest, and the essential
instrumentality for the realization of this fact in a republic
is the actual, complete, and continuous control of the Government
by the people</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>That unjust discrimination in railroad rates and service can
be abolished, we know from the experience of other nations.
Studying the railways of ten countries on the ground, examining
the railway literature and talking with leading authorities
of twenty-six countries, and analyzing the writings of
the principal critics of the various systems, I find that the
railroads of the United States are unique in two respects—the
efficiency of the service they render, and the extent and
viciousness of the discriminations they make. If efficiency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>and injustice were essentially related, we might look with
some degree of leniency on the evils of railway favoritism,
though the wise would prefer justice even at the sacrifice
of some degree of efficiency. But there is no such relation.
Efficiency is due to national characteristics and economic
conditions. In Italy I found the least efficiency coexisting
with the greatest development of railway favoritism that I
discovered anywhere in Europe, while the German roads
are highly efficient and absolutely free from favoritism. All
over Europe shippers and railway men assured me that no
concessions could be obtained on the German railroads, and
that they were the best managed roads in Europe. The
railways of France and England are less efficient than those
of Germany, and are tainted with discrimination to a degree
that is insignificant compared with the phenomena in that
line over here, but is very emphatic when compared with
the German standards. The press of Great Britain has for
years been holding up the management of the German roads
as a model to be followed in England, and attributing the
success that Germany is having in superseding English
goods with her own in many leading markets to the efficient
and far-sighted policy of her railway management.</p>

<p class='c007'>There does not seem to be any clear connection between
efficiency and the form of ownership. The private roads
of America are the most efficient and the private roads of
Italy<a id='r418'></a><a href='#f418' class='c012'><sup>[418]</sup></a> the least efficient I have examined. The public
roads of Germany and Belgium, though less efficient than
our private roads, are more efficient than the private roads
of France and England. In the same country, under like
economic conditions, either private ownership or public
ownership may secure the best management and most efficient
service according to the stage of development. In
the United States under existing political conditions the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>managers of our railways have many facts on which to base
an argument that Government operation of railroads would
be less efficient than private operation; and the fact that
our adverse political conditions are due in large part to the
private ownership of public service monopolies does not
destroy the whole force of the argument, since our rings,
bosses, party machines, spoils system, etc., are due in part
to other causes. But where public affairs can be managed
with the purity and business sense that characterize the
railway managements of Germany, Belgium, Denmark,
New Zealand, and South Africa, there is equally little reason
to doubt that public operation is the more economical
and efficient.</p>

<p class='c007'>The low average freight rate in the United States is often
adduced as conclusive proof of the efficiency of private
management. But the average freight rate in England
and France is higher than in Germany or Belgium.</p>

<p class='c007'>If it is a valid argument to say that the low average
freight rate in the United States under private ownership
proves the case as against the higher average freight rate
under the public systems, then why is it not fair to say that
the high rates in Great Britain and France under private
ownership in their turn prove the case for public ownership.
The average passenger rate in the United States and in
Great Britain is twice as high as in some of the public
systems of the continent. If the low freight rate proves
the case for private ownership, why doesn’t the low passenger
rate in Germany and Belgium prove the case for public
ownership? The fact is that such comparisons of average
rates prove nothing as to the management. Differences in
the density of traffic, grades, curves, length of haul, wages,
capitalization, etc., enter as plural causes and make it impossible
to ascertain the effect of the element under consideration.
Mr. Fink found that the ton-mile cost varied
eightfold on different lines in his own system, all under the
same management—700 percent more in some cases than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>in others. In view of that fact, of what use is it to try to
draw inferences from the average rate?</p>

<p class='c007'>Underneath our low average freight rate there are not
only vast masses of low grade freight, coal, iron, lumber,
etc., on very long hauls, but a traffic of great density
between the great cities, and innumerable discriminations
in favor of big shippers and big cities. Local rates in many
rural districts are very high, almost as high in some cases
as in the old stage-coach days. Labor is more efficient in
this country than in Europe; for example, it takes, according
to Mulhall, 2 men in England; 3 in France or Germany,
and 4½ in Europe on the average, to produce the same
agricultural product as 1 man in the United States. In
manufactures and construction work the ratios of efficiency
are nearly the same; 1 man in the United States does
almost as much as 2 men in England, 3 in France or Germany,
and 5 in Italy or Hungary. Again our Government
subsidizes the railroads by paying very large sums for the
carriage of mails, while in Europe the railways are required
to carry the mails free or for a very small payment. Moreover
our railway capitalization, though larger than it ought
to be by the amount of watered stock and fictitious securities,
is nevertheless considerably below the capitalization
of European roads. In the United States, the railways
were mostly built through a new country thinly settled in
comparison with Europe, and in many cases not settled at
all. The right of way cost practically nothing as compared
with the cost in Europe. The Government aided the construction
of a number of giant systems by enormous grants
of land and loans of money. Few roads were built that did
not receive large donations from the cities and towns which
they pass. And the abolition of grade crossings and other
safety requirements in Europe entail vast expenses from
which our roads are comparatively free.</p>

<p class='c007'>If Government operation were established in this country
under good political conditions and reasonable safeguards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>that would secure efficient management, rates could be
lower than they are now; for hundreds of millions that go
for profits on watered stock, legislative and legal expenses,
exorbitant salaries, competitive advertising, and agencies,
etc., etc., would be saved. The abolition of free passes
and freight concessions would permit a further reduction
of the tariff; so that the published rates the general
public would pay could be much lower, and even the ton-mile
average would be somewhat lower than at present.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXV.<br /> <span class='large'>HINTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Germany tried private railways for 25 years, and Austria
tried them over a quarter of a century, and they have tried
the two methods side by side ever since the public system
was organized. In New Zealand, also, and Australia the
two systems have been tried side by side. And in every
one of these countries where they have thoroughly tried
both systems the conclusion by an overwhelming consensus
of opinion is that public railways serve the public interests
best, and also make lower rates and serve the people at less
total cost. Switzerland, after a careful study of both systems
in various parts of the world, came to the same conclusion,
and her people voted 2 to 1 to transfer the railways
to public ownership and operation. All this is very strong
evidence, and if we turn from the tangled web of an international
comparison of averages and look at the principles
and causes at work in the case, it will be clear that public
ownership tends to lower rates as well as to conserve the
higher wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the same country and under similar conditions otherwise
than in respect to ownership and control, public
ownership tends as a rule to make lower rates than private
ownership. This tendency results from the fundamental
difference of aim between the two systems. Private monopoly
aims at dividends for stockholders; public ownership
aims at service for all. A normal public institution aims at
the public good, while a normal private monopoly aims at
private profit. It serves public interest also, but such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>service is incidental, and not the primary purpose. It
serves the public interest so long as it runs along in the
same direction and is linked with private profit, but when
the public interest departs from or runs counter to the
interests owning or controlling the system, the public
interests are subordinated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conflict between public and private interest is specially
strong in the matter of rates. The rate-level that
yields the greatest profit is much higher than the rate-level
that affords the greatest service, or the greatest
service without deficit; and since private monopoly aims
at profit it seeks the higher rate-level. Public ownership
aims at service, not at profit, and therefore gravitates
to the lower rate-level, where traffic and service are
greater.<a id='r419'></a><a href='#f419' class='c012'><sup>[419]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>There need be no hesitation, therefore, on economic
grounds about pressing toward the dominance of public interest,
either in the form of regulation, or, when political
conditions justify it, in the more complete form of public
ownership. And this dominance of public interest is the
only thing that can eliminate unjust discrimination and
establish an impartial railway service.</p>

<p class='c007'>The State railways of Germany, Austria, Switzerland,
Belgium, Denmark, and the Anglo-Saxon republics of
South Africa and Australasia are absolutely free from unjust
discrimination. There are no complaints or suspicions
on that score. Shippers know to a certainty that their
rivals are paying the same charges that they are. Even the
most strenuous opponents of public railways do not accuse
them of favoritism. The railways privately operated in
Holland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, are also free from
discrimination. Thorough public control, natural honesty,
and lack of overwhelming temptation have combined to produce
a pure administration. In Prussia, the Government,
strong as it was, did not succeed in preventing discrimination
on the private railways. President A. T. Hadley,
of Yale, says: “Where the system of granting special rates
becomes deeply rooted a great many are given without any
principle at all, through the caprice or favoritism of the railroad
companies and their agents.” The revelations made
before the Hepburn Committee, as to the practice of railroads
in the matter of secret rates were simply appalling.
This is the most indefensible part of the whole system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>railroad management. It is characteristic that Bismarck,
who always chose his fighting ground with skill, made
this a main base of operations in his contest against private
railroad policy in Prussia. The Prussian Cabinet in the
argument for the nationalization of the railways submitted
to the Parliament in 1879 made the following statement:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The principles of the publicity of the rates and the
equal treatment of all shippers which are embodied in the
railroad legislation of all countries, are liable, as experience
has shown, to be circumvented on account of the competing
interests of the railroads, and also by individual interests
which have influence with the managements. The granting
of these secret advantages in transportation in the most
diversified ways to individual shippers, and in particular
the so-called rebate system, is the most injurious misuse of
the powers granted to railroad corporations. It renders
government control of rates impossible, makes the competition
between the different lines, as well as that of the
shippers dependent on them, dishonorable and unfair,
carries corruption among the railroad employés, and leads
more and more to the subordination of the railroad management
to the special interests of certain powerful cliques.
It is the duty of the government to oppose this evil, to uphold
the principle of the equal treatment of all shippers,
and to enforce the legislative regulations on this subject.
The importance of this problem is only equalled by the
difficulty of its solution.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The problem was not solved till the railways were
nationalized, and then discrimination disappeared completely.
I was not able to find a shipper in Germany nor
anywhere in Europe who knew, or had heard or had even
a suspicion, of the granting of any rebate or concession of
any kind by the German roads. Many of them did not
stop with negative statements but asserted positively that
concessions could not be obtained. The nearest I came
in my search for a German fraud was the discovery of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>an English-Italian fraud on the German roads. Leading
business men in Italy told me that while they could get
no concessions from the German roads directly, they could
do it indirectly on transcontinental shipments by means of
a trick of the English traffic managers. They made their
bargains with the English manager, and he would pay a
fictitious claim for damages in transit, and then write
the German office that he paid so much for damages to
the goods and that as it was not known in what part of the
journey the goods were injured the German system must
stand its part of the loss. They have to resort to fraud to
get a discount on the German railways. The principal
motives to discrimination are absent and the dangers to
the guilty official are very great. His employers, the railway
management, and the Government back of it, are
unalterably opposed to the granting of unjust favors to any
shipper. If a traffic man should depart from the path of
impartiality the public examiners would be certain to find
it out, and the traffic man would lose his job. The railway
management is in the closest touch with the people
through the local and national councils representing commercial
bodies, labor, manufacturing, agricultural, and other
industrial interests. The law requires the railway managers
to consult these representative councils, and their
recommendations as to rates, time-tables, and other matters
of public interest are carefully considered and acted upon
so far as reasonably possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>In France the first railway manager I asked about secret
discriminations said: “There is no such thing in France.
The criminal law is very severe and it would mean imprisonment.
There were complaints of favoritism a dozen
years ago, but there have been none in recent years.”
Other railway men told me substantially the same thing.
But very different ideas were expressed by representatives
of shipping interests and others. Here are some of their
statements: “The railroads hold manufacturers and merchants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>at their mercy. They favor the great, and put the
burdens on the little fellows. The tariffs are full of special
rates, and 80 or 85 percent of these special rates are
made simply for some favored merchant or manufacturer.
The minister can reject or approve a tariff as a whole, but
has no detailed power over one bad rate. If he retires a
tariff the old one comes into effect. It is true that complaints
are not made. What is the use? The danger is too
great. Where is the merchant who dare undertake a campaign
against the great companies?” I was assured that
the statement of M. Cawes, vol. iv, p. 136, of the “Cours
d’Économique politique,” was still true: “The benefit
of reduced tariffs is accorded upon secret approaches
and solicitations; the companies dispense at their will industrial
prosperity and ruin.” The discrimination between
localities is very great, owing largely to the way in which
the railways are laid out. And “the companies defeat the
national protective tariff by letting foreign goods ride more
cheaply than French goods.” For example, American
wheat from Havre to Paris pays 18 francs per ton, while
French wheat from Ferte-Bernard to Paris, 37 miles less
distance, pays 20 francs a ton. If the nation desires to
favor the importation of foreign products, well and good,
but it is a curious state of things for the Government to
adopt a protective policy and then permit private railways
to reverse, overrule, and nullify that policy.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already had occasion to throw a side light on
English railroad methods in describing the way in which
Italian rebaters use the elasticity of the English railway
system to get fictitious damages. I had to go to Italy to
find the true character of the English railway conscience.
The railway men in England won’t tell. And nobody else,
who will tell, knows. Yet the English traffic man, though
willing to pay fake damage claims on proper occasions, is
innocent of “flying tariffs,” terminal railway abuses,
systematic underbilling, classification jugglery, and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>preferential paraphernalia that belong to an up-to-date
railway system over here. The last case of personal discrimination
in rates that caused any stir was tried about
6 years ago and the preference was so small that one of
our trust magnates, used to looking at large concessions,
would not have been able to find it without a microscope.
Nevertheless a considerable number of complaints (more
than a hundred a year on the average) came before the
Board of Trade and the Railway Commissioners under the
traffic acts of 1888 and 1894. The Secretary of the Board
of Trade tells me that these complaints relate chiefly to
“high rates, poor facilities, and discriminations.” About
half the complaints charge excessive rates which amount
in most cases, on the face of the complaint, to discrimination
between places or commodities. A large number
of complaints concern higher charges for short hauls than
for longer hauls on the same line, and another large group
allege disproportionate charges or higher rates for shorter
distances as compared with the rates on other lines. A
fourth group, containing about 25 percent of all the cases,
includes complaints of delay, overcharges, refusal of facilities
or privileges accorded others, personal preferences
in rates, etc. For example the London and Northwestern
charged the complainant 12 cents a ton up to 20 miles
for hauling coal, while charging the complainant’s competitors
only 9 cents. Preferential treatment was alleged
in the rates given to rival shipping companies for the
conveyance of goods from Hull to places in Yorkshire. A
coal shipper complained that the Midland Railway had
for many years made a practice of allowing a rebate of 6
cents a ton to large dealers, and that in the lists of rates
furnished the complainant no mention was made of this
rebate or allowance, though other rebates were mentioned.
The Midland replied that the system had been in operation
since 1889, when the company gave notice as required
by law, in the public rate-books, that they would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>allow a rebate to traders whose annual tonnage exceeded
25,000 tons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English law does not object to the paying of a commission
on a large amount of traffic provided the same
discount is given to all shippers who attain the stated
volume of business, but a higher commission to one big
shipper than to another big shipper is vigorously repressed.
A case of this kind was decided by the Railroad Commission
in 1901. The court found that the Midland Railway
had given Rickett, Smith &amp; Company, coal dealers, a preference
of ¼ of one percent in rebates on their annual traffic
account, and it enjoined the railway and allowed damages
to the complaining shippers. Some 75 suits were entered
by different shippers for this one cause. In the same
report 28 cases are listed relating to discrimination in
brewery traffic, and 16 other applications for injunctions
against undue preference in respect to facilities, rates on
coke, brick, flour and grain, and other commodities to certain
shippers or particular places, and one request from
the Inverness Chamber of Commerce for an order enjoining
the railways from selling season tickets to big shippers
(with a traffic worth $1,200 to $5,000 or more a year) at
lower rates than they will sell them to ordinary passengers.
This last application was dismissed by the court. England
does not object to premiums on volume, provided all
shippers of equal size receive the same treatment. That’s
the principle the Trusts believe in; if vigorously worked
the principle is a powerful trust builder.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English Commission has power to enjoin undue
preference in rates or facilities and give damages for the
same, to fix reasonable charges in some cases, and to order
rates increased since the revision of 1892 to be reduced to
the previous level on proof of unreasonableness.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the last report at hand, dated 1903, and relating to the
year 1902, there are 270 odd cases, 95 of which charge
undue preference, and as these matters come first before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>the Board of Trade, which does not grant an appeal to the
Commission unless it believes there is cause of action, the
probability is that all or nearly all of these applications are
based on a real discrimination.<a id='r420'></a><a href='#f420' class='c012'><sup>[420]</sup></a> It appears that 72 of the
suits are for damages growing out of the Rickett rebate
case; the rest are scattering. A few examples will show
their character: 1. Application for order enjoining railways
to desist from undue preference to complainant’s
competitors through rebates on flour. 2. For injunction
against railways granting preferences to the firm of Leethan
&amp; Sons on their traffic. This case was tried, the preference
found, and the injunction granted. 3. Undue preferences
to certain manufacturers of pig iron in the rates
on coke. 4. Undue preference to a certain shipping company
through superior facilities and lower rates than were
given to others on the same goods and the same routes.
Case settled before trial. 5. Undue preference to Corral
&amp; Company by rebates on coal to certain stations while
refusing to make the same allowances to other shippers.
6. Charging higher rates than E. on coal to the same
point. Case tried, undue preference found. 7. Refusal
of allowances for cartage made to others. 8. Refusal to
supply cars in due proportion. 9. Preference of competing
millers and subjecting traffic of applicant to undue
prejudice. 10. Preference of brewers at Burton and Lichfield
by low rates and terminal allowances. 11. Preferences
in favor of brick-makers in Nuncaton and Tamworth
by assessing the weights of their bricks lower than the
bricks of complainants. 12. Allowing 93 cents a ton for
services in loading and unloading, etc., and refusing similar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>allowances for similar services by other shippers. 13. Undue
preference through higher rates on coal for domestic
use than on coal for export, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English Railway Act of 1888 provides that “no railway
company shall make any difference in the tolls, rates
or charges made for, or any difference in the treatment of
home and foreign merchandise, in respect of the same or
similar services.” But this part of the law has been
constantly and vigorously violated as we shall see in a
moment. The main aim of the English Government has
been to keep the railways from lifting the rates or overcharging,
and it has carried this to a point which, with the
strenuous provisions against grade crossings and in respect
to fencing and other safety measures, has gone far to discourage
English railway development. The companies
submit classifications and schedules of maximum rates and
charges to the Board of Trade, which hears all objections
and tries to arrive at an agreement with the companies.
The agreed tariffs, or, in cases where no agreement is
reached, the tariffs the Board thinks ought to be adopted,
are embodied in Bills, introduced to Parliament, and after
hearing if need be enacted into law. Thus Parliament
enacts a tariff of maximum charges, and the law forbids
discrimination, and “whenever it is shown that any railway
company charges one trader or class of traders, or the
traders in any district, lower tolls, rates, or charges for the
same or similar merchandise, or lower tolls, rates, or
charges for the same or similar services, than they charge
to other traders, or classes of traders, or to the traders in
another district, or make any difference in treatment in
respect of any such trader or traders, the burden of proving
that such lower charge or difference in treatment does
not amount to an undue preference shall lie on the railway
company.” The long-haul abuse is met by a provision
free from any ambiguous “similar circumstances and conditions”
clause. “The Commissioners shall have power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>to direct that no higher charge shall be made to any person
for services in respect of merchandise carried over a less
distance than is made to any other person for similar services
in respect of the like description and quantity of
merchandise carried over a greater distance on the same
line of railway.” Section 31, provides that if any person
believes a railway is making an unreasonable charge, or
treating him in any respect in an oppressive or unreasonable
manner he may complain to the Board of Trade, which
shall endeavor to settle the difficulty by conciliation and
arbitration. If this is not possible, and the case comes
within the jurisdiction of the Railway Commission the
Board will give the plaintiff a certificate to take the matter
before the Commission for adjudication. Under Section
1 of the Act of 1894 complaints may be made of the
unreasonable increase of any rate, directly or indirectly,
since December 31, 1892, and if the Board cannot effect an
amicable settlement the complainant may submit the case
to the Railway Commission for judgment. Some Northampton
traders at once began proceedings under this law,
and after 2 years of litigation at a cost to the plaintiffs
of $10,000 they got a verdict, but the companies declined
to accept the case as a test, so that any one who feels
aggrieved by an excessive rate must spend the time and
money necessary to carry his case through the Commissioners’
Court to a decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Board of Trade reports to Parliament every few
years all the complaints presented to it and the disposition
thereof. By the last report at hand, issued in 1902 and
covering the years 1899, 1900, and 1901, it appears that
nearly 3,000 complaints (2,946) have been filed from 1888
to 1902,—2,032 related to “unreasonable increase of rates”
since 1892, and in 101 of these cases, when no amicable
settlement could be made, the Board gave certificates of
appeal to the Commission, but only a few of the complaints
were carried up. Complaint of excessive rates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>(not cases of increase) numbered 423, 88 of them in
the last 3 years reported: higher charge for shorter distance
than for a longer haul on the same line, 66, 11 of
them in the last 3 years; disproportionate rates, or higher
charge for a given distance on one line than on another
157, 37 of them in the last 2 years; and 268 miscellaneous
cases, 95 of which were entered in the last 3 years. About
4 percent of the complaints relate to canals, the rest are
railway cases. It takes 50 large pages to state the 325
complaints entered in the last 3 years. A very large part,
practically all in fact, are either in form or in substance,
cases of discrimination; even in complaints of excessive
rates the gist of the charge is usually that the rates complained
of are excessive as compared with other rates
the companies make.<a id='r421'></a><a href='#f421' class='c012'><sup>[421]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A few further concrete illustrations from recent years
may be of interest. 1. Refusal of free cartage to a manufacturer
though another mill further away had the benefit
of free delivery. 2. Refusal of allowance for loading, etc.,
on private siding though such allowance was made to a
rival firm. 3. Rates on coal from mines at Leigh and
Abram to Winnington, 26 miles, were 50 cents a ton
against 42 cents from the mine at Haydock, 29 miles. 4.
Complaints of delay, insufficient facilities, etc. 5. Fourteen
complaints of increased charges for conveyance of
small parcels in freight-train transportation and that companies
were not following a decision of the Railway
Commission. One of the complaints on the ground just
stated was filed against the railways generally by the
Co-operative Wholesale Society with practically 10,000,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>people back of it in interest and sympathy. The companies
revised the schedule and reduced the rates. 6.
Refusal to grant complainant the same facilities for warehousing
traffic as are granted to their competitors. The
Board succeeded in removing the preference without trial.
7. A rate of $11.25 on india-rubber goods from Birmingham
to Newcastle-on-Tyne against $8.95 on the same goods
intended for export. 8. One shipper stated that he was
charged $9.75 for a carload of coal (6 tons) from Cork to
Baltimore, while the Baltimore Fishery Schools were
charged only $5.10 for the same service. After the usual
correspondence by the Board of Trade the matter was
settled by the railroads agreeing to give the plaintiff the
same rate as the Fishery Schools. 9. Another shipper
alleged that since he had sent his traffic from Methven via
the North British route from Perth instead of the Caledonian,
the company had delayed his traffic at Perth while
other traffic was sent on; that the company had deprived
him of the use of facilities formerly enjoyed, and had
stopped his credit. This reads almost like an American
case.</p>

<p class='c007'>The long and short haul cases also remind one of home
in about the same ratio that a raspberry bush reminds one
of a full grown oak. Both personal preference and the
long-haul discrimination are comparatively rare in England.
The greatest resemblance to America is in the rates on
imports. The English railway manager has as good an
appetite for foreign goods as any American manager, and
in this matter the law does not tie him up as it does in so
many respects with its maximum rates and large discretion
in the Railway Commissioners to prevent excessive rates
and undue preference. Foreign linen goes from Liverpool
to London for $6.10 a ton while home linen pays $9.25 or
50 percent more. Foreign woolen and worsted goods are
carried from Manchester to London for $6.10, against
$9.75 or 60 percent more for English goods. Foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>timber travels from Hartlepool to Wimeaton for $3.12 a
ton while English timber pays $7.50 or 130 percent more.
English dressed meats from Liverpool to London $12.50
a ton, American meat $6.25, just half the home charge.
American cattle slaughtered at the wharf in Glasgow,
$11.25 to London, home beef, $19.25. Cheese goes all the
way from New York past Chelford and other English
stations for less than the rate from those stations to
London.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Foreign hops are conveyed from Boulogne, via Folkestone,
to London at $4.37 per ton, while the charge from
Ashford, on the same line of railway and much nearer to
London, is $8.75—or just twice the amount for about half
the distance.... The rates for imported butter, cheese,
bacon, lard, and wool from Southampton Docks to London,
distance seventy-six miles, is $1.50 per ton. From Botley
in the same county, and a similar distance, the rate for all
these goods is $4.80, or 219 percent more than for foreign
stuff. The difference in rates between Southampton Dock
station (foreign) and the Southampton Town station
(home) is as follows: Hops $1.50 and $5; apples $1.25
and $3.22; pressed hay $1.25 and $2.50; eggs $1.66 and
$5. Further, Professor Hunter showed that while French
fruit is charged at the rate of 4½ cents per ton per mile to
London by the South Eastern, the same company charge
Kentish farmers 11 cents per ton per mile, or more than
double.”<a id='r422'></a><a href='#f422' class='c012'><sup>[422]</sup></a> The London <cite>Times</cite> declares that “there are
no arguments within the range of human ingenuity that
will convince a Sussex hop-grower of the equity of an
arrangement by which foreign hops are brought from the
other side of the Channel for less than he has to pay to get
across Surrey.... For nothing can shake the belief of the
home producer, and in our view nothing ought to shake it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>in the argument that if these low rates pay the companies,
he is shamefully overcharged, while if they do not pay, he
is still overcharged to cover the loss and bring up the
average.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is evident that England is far from being free from
unfair discrimination. A system of maximum rates, with
penalties for undue preference, and a commission able
to countermand an unreasonable increase of rates, is not
sufficient.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Canada a railway commission of three appointed by
the Governors in Council for ten years (but removable at
any time by the Governors in Council for cause) has absolute
power over rates, classification, speed, safety appliances,
etc.<a id='r423'></a><a href='#f423' class='c012'><sup>[423]</sup></a> The railways may submit tariffs, but the Board
can approve or disapprove of them in whole or in part, and
prescribe such rates and classification as it deems best, and
the railroads cannot charge either more or less than the
rates authorized by the Commission. All undue preferences
between persons and localities in rates or facilities is forbidden,
but “the tolls for larger quantities, greater numbers,
or longer distances may be proportionately less than
the tolls for smaller quantities or numbers, or shorter distances,
if such tolls are, under substantially similar circumstances,
charged equally to all persons. The Board shall not
approve or allow any toll, which for the like description of
goods or for passengers, carried under substantially similar
circumstances and conditions in the same direction over the
same line, is greater for a shorter than for a longer distance,
the shorter being included in the longer distance, unless the
Board is satisfied that, owing to competition, it is expedient
to allow such a toll.” The burden of proof is on the company
to show that any difference of treatment does not
amount to an unjust discrimination. And “the Board may
determine, as questions of fact, whether or not traffic is or
has been carried under substantially similar circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>and conditions, and whether there has, in any case, been
unjust discrimination, or undue or unreasonable preference
or advantage, or prejudice or disadvantage, within the
meaning of this Act, or whether in any case the company
has or has not complied with the provisions of this and
the last preceding section; and may by regulation declare
what shall constitute substantially similar circumstances
and conditions, or unjust or unreasonable preferences, advantages,
prejudices, or disadvantages within the meaning
of this Act, or what shall constitute compliance or noncompliance
with the provisions of this and the last preceding
section relating to discrimination, long-haul,” etc.
No Supreme Court rulings can knock out this Commission,
for it has clear authority in the law to interpret its provisions
as it deems best, to accomplish the purpose in view.
Whether this law will work well or ill is not yet apparent.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Holland, where the railways are owned by the State
and operated by private companies under lease from the
Government, the Ministry assured me that unfair discriminations
between persons and places do not exist, and I have
every reason to believe they are right. The President of
the Government railways in Denmark said: “There are
no discriminations either on the public or company railroads.
It would not be possible to give such favors in
Denmark.” And in reference to my description of some
of the American methods of favoritism, he said that nothing
of the kind had been attempted; and if it should be, every
one concerned in the transaction would be punished, and
the guilty officials would lose their positions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Railway men and publicists of Norway and Sweden tell
me that there is no discrimination. It would not be permitted.
There are no provisions against it in the law.
Nothing of the kind has ever been known.</p>

<p class='c007'>A high official of the Japanese Government, whom I
met in this country a few months ago, said in answer to
a question in which I stated some of our discrimination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>methods, large and small: “The government fixes maximum
and minimum rates, and the companies are free between
these limits, except that the Minister keeps control
sufficient to compel fair rates if the companies should try
to discriminate or otherwise make unjust rates. We have
had nothing like the Beef Trust or Standard Oil discriminations
you describe, nor any personal favoritism in
rate-making, but the government means to prevent the
possibility.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The railways of New Zealand are not troubled with
complaints of discrimination, nor those of New South
Wales or Queensland or Victoria. And in these boiling
and bubbling republics, if there were the slightest suspicion
of a reason for attacking the Government management
on this ground, it would be done by the political
opponents of the administrations. South Australia has
had one case of alleged favoritism. The complaint was
that the Railway Commissioner gave a reduced rate on
carload lots of certain goods to certain points, to meet
water competition. A shipper, desiring to send his goods
at low rates in the opposite direction, asked the Commission
to give him a reduction equal to that accorded on
the traffic above mentioned. The Commissioner said he
would give the same reductions if the shipments were
made in carload lots. The complaining shipper could
not do this, as his trade was not sufficient. The matter
was brought before Parliament, and Parliament sustained
the Commissioner. The Parliament of each of these republics
acts as the people’s board of directors of all public
works, calling the managers to account; and any member,
from the remotest rural district, can ask the Ministry and
the railway management any question he chooses, and
compel full disclosure of the facts. Secrecy is practically
impossible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Government railways of Natal and Central South
Africa are equally free from secret concessions and favoritisms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>of every kind. In talking with the manager of the
Central South African Government railway, I explained
the nature of the favors granted to the big shippers in the
United States, using the Beef Trust, Salt Trust, Oil Trust,
Fuel Company, etc., as illustrations, and said: “Suppose a
big concern tried to get special rates or concessions of some
kind on your railroads, and made a secret agreement with
the railway management?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not? Human nature is the same in South Africa
as in America. Suppose they made some traffic man a partner
in their profits or brought pressure enough on him in
some way to get a concession?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It wouldn’t be possible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, why? Suppose it were possible, what would
happen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Government auditors would find it out, and the
manager would lose his position.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Couldn’t he cover up the thing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not for any length of time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The people would have a fit if anything like that were
attempted,” said a member of the manager’s staff.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have no attempts to secure preference, then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No it is not even attempted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If those who employ and discharge the traffic managers
desire discrimination or aim at results which can be forwarded
by discrimination, then discrimination will exist
unless the public control is strong enough to keep the big
shippers and the people in possession of the railroads from
carrying out their purposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, on the other hand, those who employ and discharge
the traffic men are sincerely opposed to discrimination and
aim at results that can only be secured by just and impartial
management, then the traffic man who is guilty of
favoritism will lose his job, and the utmost possible
discouragement is put upon unjust discrimination.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>Once more the vital conclusions seem to be, the necessity
of the dominance of public interest, and the value of being in
possession or having your own servants in possession instead
of merely giving orders to the servants of another in possession
who may or may not obey, and who are in no danger
of losing their positions by disobeying you and may gain
greatly by it—the value of having public interest at the
helm to steer the vessel in a safe course, instead of keeping
private interest at the wheel while public interest stands on
a steam tug with a big whistle and shouts orders through
the fog to the steersman on the passenger liner who is more
than half inclined to steer the ship as he pleases, and gets
his pay and employment from men who do not wish the
public orders carried out, and whose instructions vary
widely therefrom. You cannot expect the servants of
others to obey your orders as well as your own servants,
especially if the said servants of others are employed by
persons whose interests are largely contrary to your own.
Neither can a commander be as sure of winning a victory
at the head of an army trained in the camp of the enemy
owing allegiance to them, and constantly receiving orders
from them, as he could at the head of his own proper troops.<a id='r424'></a><a href='#f424' class='c012'><sup>[424]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Is it fair to try to control in your own interest property
that does not belong to you? It is fair to try to exert
sufficient control to secure impartial treatment of persons,
places, and industries; but can this be done without fixing
rates, and if this is resorted to will it not result either in
squeezing the life out of railway enterprise or in a vicious
struggle for mastery with new evasions of law and further
intensification of political evils, and corporate control of
Government? You will either deprive the owner of the
right to determine the price at which the product of his
plant shall be sold, thus controlling his profit and sapping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>his energy and incentive, or you will put a premium on
political corruption by making it necessary for the railroad
owner to control the Government in order to control his
business and its profits. You will check the development
of railways and drive capital into industries where the
owners are free to fix prices, or you will check the movement
toward political purity. Public control in some form
is absolutely necessary in order to safeguard the public
interest. The only question relates to the form and degree.
Is effective and adequate public control of transport, with
the unity, freedom, and hearty co-operation that should
characterize all business ventures, possible without public
ownership? And if not, isn’t it true that the economic
and governmental changes necessary to make public ownership
safe and successful constitute the essence of the
ultimate railroad problem?</p>

<p class='c007'>If the railways were united into a national system
under a great leader like James J. Hill, or A. J. Cassatt,
free to operate the roads on business principles, untrammelled
by the spoils system or any political control, backed
by a public interest that would not tolerate favoritism,
partyism, political influence or graft in any form, working
with public aims and public motives instead of private
aims and motives, managing the roads for the whole people
as stockholders instead of for a small part of the people as
stockholders, paid, in common with the whole body of
employees, on the basis of a fixed remuneration plus an
additional compensation proportioned to efficiency, and in
constant consultation with local and national councils representing
commercial, manufacturing, mining, labor, and
agricultural organizations and interests, we should have a
railway system and management whose efficiency would
astonish the world, whose methods would bear the light,
and whose administration would be an honor to twentiethcentury
civilization.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'>A.<a id='AppendixA'></a>—THE COAL-CARRYING DECISION, U. S. SUPREME COURT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Since this book was put in type the United States Supreme
Court has sustained the Interstate Commerce Commission
in an important suit brought by the Commission against
the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, and the New York,
New Haven and Hartford Railroad under the Elkins Act.
The Chesapeake and Ohio agreed to deliver at New Haven
60,000 tons of coal at an aggregate cost which, after deducting
the market price of the coal at the mines and the
cost of transportation from Newport News to Connecticut,
would leave the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway only about
28 cents a ton for carrying the coal to Newport News,
while the published tariff was $1.45 per ton. Suit was
brought by the Interstate Commission to enjoin the carrying
out of this contract. The Government challenged the
right of an Interstate carrier to perform a contract to sell
and deliver merchandise (coal) whenever the price to be
received by the railway is inadequate to cover its actual
outlay, plus the published freight rates, upon the ground
that the actual result would be discrimination and failure
to collect the published tariff, in violation of the Interstate
Commerce Law. The answer of the railway company was
in effect that it charged the full rate for transportation, but
sold the coal at less than market rates, at a price in fact
which involved a loss, and that special circumstances justified
it in so doing. The companies maintained that, when
acting in good faith, they had, as dealers, the right to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>contracts at a fixed price for sale and delivery extending
over a series of years and then go into the market, buy the
merchandise, and deliver it at destination, notwithstanding
that what they received therefor might not be sufficient to
yield them a net sum equal to the published freight rate,
according to which shippers generally were charged.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a strong decision rendered February 19, 1906, the
Supreme Court upheld the contention of the Government,
declaring that a carrier cannot deal in the goods it carries
in such a way as to evade the provisions of the Interstate
Commerce Act, and therefore a railway cannot buy and
sell and underbid other owners of similar goods who are
dependent on the railroad for the transportation of their
goods to market. “The existence of such a power would
enable a carrier, if it chose to do so, to select the favored
persons from whom he would buy and the favored persons
to whom he would sell, thus giving such persons an advantage
over every other, and leading to a monopolization in
the hands of such persons of all the products as to which
the carrier chose to deal.... Because no express prohibition
against a carrier who engages in interstate commerce
becoming a dealer in commodities moving in such commerce
is found in the act, it does not follow that the provisions
which are expressed in that act should not be applied and
be given their lawful effect.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court quotes an English case, Attorney General v.
The Great Northern Railway, in which the Vice-Chancellor
decided on common-law principles that a railway could not
deal in coal because such dealing was incompatible with
its duties as a public carrier and calculated to inflict injury
on the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>The decision is important, and the railways, it is said,
have already begun to part company with their coal mines.
But it must not be expected that the evil at the bottom of
this case can be so easily eradicated. It will be a simple
matter to put the coal mines in the hands of special companies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>controlled by the same men who control the railways,
and the coal company and the railway can together
continue to do precisely what the railway alone has been
doing in the double capacity of dealer and carrier.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within a week of its decision sustaining the Commission
in the coal-carrying case, the Supreme Court has reversed
the Commission and the Circuit Court in the orange routing
case. In 1899 all the railways of Southern California
fixed a through rate of $1.25 per hundred on oranges from
California to the Missouri River and the East, reserving
the right to route the freight. The Fruit Growers Association
complained of this as depriving shippers of their
right to route their shipments and as virtually constituting
a pooling agreement or combination in violation of the
Interstate Act. The Commission and the Circuit Court
sustained this contention, but the U. S. Supreme Court has
now (March, 1906) sustained the railroad plea that they
have a right to fix through rates on condition of determining
the routing themselves.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>B.<a id='AppendixB'></a>—REGULATION OF RATES.</h3>

<p class='c014'>In the Boston <cite>Transcript</cite> for February 24, 1906, President
Hadley, of Yale University, criticises the Hepburn
Bill because it makes “the decision of the Commission itself
final on all questions of fact,” and he predicts that if
such a bill is enacted into law it will be a failure, although
he does not believe it practicable to obtain a better measure
now.</p>

<p class='c007'>President Hadley bases his prediction of failure on his
interpretation of the experience of England. He says
that the English Railway Act, 1873, “had many points of
resemblance to the Hepburn bill. It provided for a commission
which, besides ascertaining the rates charged by
railroads and making reports to Parliament concerning
their management, should also be empowered to investigate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>complaints concerning unjust rates of discrimination
in facilities and give adequate and speedy relief. It was
intended to have the quick jurisdiction of these Commissioners
supplant the slow jurisdiction of the older courts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The twenty-sixth section of the act undertakes to restrict
narrowly the opportunity for appeal from the judgment
of the Commission. The Commissioners themselves
may state a case; on the case thus stated, and no further,
the courts on appeal may decide what is the law. This
was intended not only to shut out the retrial of questions
of fact, but to give to the Commission, as far as the circumstances
admitted, the power of deciding which were
questions of fact and which were not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Committee of 1883 is quoted as finding that “a
case has been made out for granting to litigants before the
Railway Commission a right of appeal,” and we are told
that the Committee were “all agreed that the attempt to
prevent appeals from the Commissioners’ decisions had
been a complete failure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>President Hadley further says: “Parliament has abandoned
the theory on which the act (of 1873) was based,
because the courts did not carry out the law, but insisted
on retrying questions in their entirety, instead of acquiescing
in the attempt to separate the law from the facts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And we are told that “the evil effects of the attempt
to give the English Railroad Commission power of fixing
rates did not stop here. The attempted performance of
this duty took up so much of their time that they failed to
perform other duties, which under more favorable circumstances
they might have carried out efficiently and usefully.
They did not have that influence on the formation of railroad
tariffs which their experience and high position would
otherwise have secured.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now as a matter of fact the English law never attempted
to give the Railway Commission power to fix rates, except
a very limited power in relation to through rates when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>companies cannot agree, nor was it intended that the Commission
should have anything to do with the “formation of
tariffs.” Rates are fixed, not by the Commission, but by
Parliament with the advice of the Board of Trade. When
Parliament orders a revision of the maximum rates, the
railways and the Board of Trade try to agree on new
schedules, and the Board embodies its conclusions in Provisional
Orders or rate bills which are passed by Parliament
with or without amendment as it sees fit. This was
true in 1873 and has been true ever since. The Commission’s
duty in this connection was and is to hear complaints
of undue preference, and rates alleged to exceed the maxima
fixed by Parliament. If a through rate proposed by
any company is objected to by any forwarding company, the
Commission has power to allow or reject the rate subject
to the limitation that it cannot require a company to carry
at lower mileage rates than it is legally charging for like
business on any other line between the same points. (Sections
11, 12, Railway Act of 1873.) The Commission may
also determine the division of through rates if the companies
cannot agree. Since the Railway Act of 1894 the
Commission has jurisdiction under Section 1 to order a return
to former rates charged by the company in case complaint
is made of an increase above the rates charged in
1892 (the date of the last Provisional Orders or tariff revision),
and the burden of proof is on the company to show
that the increase is reasonable. This puts a limitation on
the companies’ rate-making power in addition to the limit
of the parliamentary maxima, for no matter how much below
the maximum a rate in actual use in 1892 might have
been, it cannot be increased if the Commission on complaint
and hearing forbids it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further, it is not the case that Parliament “abandoned
the theory of the act of 1873” in the sense the reader
might gather from the statements made by President Hadley.
On the contrary, the Railway Act of 1888 (which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>resulted from the investigation of 1882, quoted by Hadley)
distinctly provides in section 17 that “no appeal shall lie
from the Commissioners upon a question of fact.” Subject
to this provision an appeal was given to a superior court
of appeal, the change being that under the old law the case
went up on a statement by the Commission, which could
therefore itself determine what were questions of law and
what were questions of fact, while under the new law the
case went up on the record and the court above determined
what questions of law were involved. But the new law is
exactly like the old in making the judgment of the Commission
final on all questions of fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>The truth is that England never attempted anything
like the system of regulation embodied in the Hepburn
Bill; never delegated to any commission the power to fix
reasonable rates or make reasonable regulations in place of
rates or regulations found on complaint and hearing to be
unjust, but she has done and continues to do the other
thing that President Hadley gives us to understand she
has tried and abandoned, viz., the intrusting of power to a
Railway Commission to render final decision on questions
of fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the <cite>Transcript</cite> of April 1, 1905, President Hadley
says he “urged that a single hearing in the railroad court
was better than two successive hearings by two different
kinds of bodies. Mr. Hepburn’s committee desires to avoid
the double hearing, but it undertakes to do it by eliminating
the court instead of the Commission. There is reason
to fear that this plan will not work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That may be true. There is reason to fear that no plan
for government control of these giant interests will work
so long as the ownership is divorced from the said control.
As stated in the text, one of the ablest and most honorable
of our railroad presidents, in answer to my question as to
what would happen if the Interstate Commission were
really given power to fix rates, replied, “The Commission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>would have to be controlled, that’s all.” And when I
quoted this to one of the leading members of the Interstate
Commission his comment was, “I always said the
railroads would own the Commission as soon as it was
worth owning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Even without owning the Commission the railroads can
block it pretty effectually by secret practices, extensive
forgetfulness on the witness stand, persistent persecution
of shippers who make complaint, cunning evasions, and interminable
litigation. It is quite likely the proposed regulation
will not realize what is hoped for from it, but we
cannot predict such failure from English experience as
President Hadley does when he says, “The history of
English railroad regulation shows that a similar measure,
passed under closely analogous circumstances, failed to do
the good which its advocates expected. The same failure
is likely to be repeated in the United States.” The Hepburn
Bill in its scope and directness is very different from
anything that England has attempted. It is quite likely
that England may try some more vigorous measure than
she has yet adopted, but in spite of all her efforts at regulation
Mr. W. M. Acworth, the classic railway writer of
England from the railway standpoint, corresponding to
President Hadley in this country, told me a few months
ago that dissatisfaction with the railway situation is so
great in England that “9 out of 10 would vote for public
ownership of the roads if the question were submitted
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The general failure of regulation in England to accomplish
what was expected of it, may suggest a broad conclusion
as to this country, but a specific conclusion from
any parallel to the Hepburn Bill is not possible, because no
such parallel has been tried.</p>

<p class='c007'>President Hadley thinks one hearing is enough, provided
it is a hearing before a court, not before the Commission.
Like the railroads, President Hadley has no use for the Commission.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>The reason perhaps is the conscious or subconscious
appreciation of the fact that rate-making involves a
vigorous <em>administrative</em> element, which the Commission has
shown a tendency to use with great effectiveness, while a
body constituted as a court, by its very nature and traditions,
is loath to exercise administrative power or in any way
disturb its exercise by the companies except on the clearest
kind of proof of the adequacy of the new rate or condition
proposed, which cannot in many cases be obtained at all
except by <em>bona fide</em> trial of the new rate or regulation,
since a rate that is even below the present operating cost
may develop traffic enough to give it ample justification.
Courts do not like to trust to future proof. If rates do
not seem justified on existing facts as shown by accounts
presented by the companies, the courts are apt to turn the
new rates down without a trial, as the United States Supreme
Court did in the Nebraska case when the law of that
State fixing rates on local traffic was declared unconstitutional.
The companies made the division between through
local costs to suit themselves, and the Court not only
accepted their figures, but neglected to take into account
the fact that lower rates might easily develop new traffic
enough to cover the slight additional margin needed even
on the companies’ own showing.</p>

<p class='c007'>President Hadley says: “What the United States needs
is an act under which the Commission will take part in the
making of tariffs and give effect to the public interest in
the general questions of railroad management, leaving the
specific cases of violation to be stopped or punished by the
courts.” Very good. But how is the Commission to take
part in the making of tariffs? If it is to do any more than
to give advice (the efficacy of which is nil when it comes
up against the Beef Trust, Standard Oil, or other big
private interest), it must have authority, general or particular,
to fix rates when the railways do not make them just
and reasonable. In England Parliament fixes maximum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>rates on the basis of Board of Trade studies, and the commission
acts as a court. The plan has not prevented either
discrimination or extortion, but has taken the life out of
the railways to a large extent. In this country it is proposed
to try the plan of letting a public board fix individual
maximum rates when injustice is shown. As there is
an appeal to the Federal courts and as Hadley declares
that the courts insist on retrying questions in their entirety,
it would seem that the very system President Hadley advocates
would really come into being under the Hepburn
Bill,—the Commission will have a part in fixing the rates,
and violations of law will really be determined by the
courts.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Pass discrimination alone, it is estimated, amounts to some 200,000 free
transits a day, or over 70 millions in a year. And as for freight discriminations,
the reader who follows this history through will see that like the leaves
of the forest they defy computation. Just a hint may be given here. Every
day that one of the 300,000 private cars is carried at the present mileage rates,
a discrimination is made in favor of the owner of the private car,—a hundred
millions of unjust discriminations, possibly, in this one item.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. The New York Central, Baltimore and Ohio, and some other lines announced
the same purpose as the Pennsylvania in respect to passes after
January 1, 1906, but with them as with the Pennsylvania it appears to be a
case of more careful discrimination in the use of discrimination, and an appreciation
of the fact that it is very important to make a good impression on
the public mind just now, in view of the widespread demand for drastic legislation
in the direction of railroad regulation.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. A number of the States have laws against passes. The Interstate

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. In one case it appeared that a leading railroad attorney had been for
years in the habit of supplying jurors with passes. Opposing counsel
brought out the fact that all the jurors in the case on trial had accepted
passes from the railroad company which was the defendant in the case,
and that to have an equal chance for justice his client would have to give
each juror $50 to offset the railroad gifts. The judge discharged the whole
jury.</p>

get passes, trying first through the American ambassadors in Vienna, Berlin,
and Brussels, and afterward by direct appeal to the railway management.
But it was of no use, although I had a letter from the Chairman of the United
States Industrial Commission saying that I had rendered the government
valuable service in connection with the work of the Commission, and that any
courtesies shown me or assistance afforded me in my researches would be a
public service. I had other strong letters from men of high distinction in the
United States and England, and our ambassador at Berlin had been president
of my alma mater when I was in college, and was specially friendly and helpful;
but I was assured that no amount of influence or pull could secure a pass
or any other personal favor on the State railways.</p>

and that some railways sold their tickets to competitive points to
brokers, paying them a commission for making the sale, out of which the
brokers scalped the rate. (Industrial Commission, 1900, iv, p. 334.)</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r34'>34</a>. In many cases the direct rate between two points, X and Y, was found to
be greater than the combination of the rate from X past Y to a competitive
point Z and the local rate back from Z to Y. For example, goods could
be shipped from the Pacific coast to Kansas City and then back to points west
of Kansas City more cheaply than they could be sent direct from the coast to
these intermediate points. This enabled a shipper informed of the combination
rates to get an advantage over one with less information who relied on
the published tariffs stating the rates between his place of business and the
points to or from which his shipments were to be sent. The Commission took
up this matter in 1887 and the traffic managers of the roads agreed to revise
their tariffs so that the direct local rate should in no case exceed the through
rate plus the local rate back from the terminus or competitive point. This
rule resulted in many material reductions of the rates to intermediate points;
for example, the points between Denver and the Missouri River on the lines
controlled by the Southern Pacific. See Martin <em>v.</em> Southern Pacific R.R.

any violation of the statute, and most of the accounting officers testified to the
effect that if rebates had been paid they would necessarily know about it and
that their accounts did not show any such payments. It was nevertheless
fully established by the investigation that secret rate concessions had been

<p class='c007'><a href='#r68'>68</a>. The railway charged the same rates from the East to Grand Rapids as to
Ionia, although the former was 33 miles a longer distance point on the same
line of road, and in addition gave free cartage to Grand Rapids companies.
Complaint was made in September, 1888; April 26, 1890, the Commission held
the free cartage to be in effect a rebate, and ordered the railroad to desist from
giving free cartage in Grand Rapids. (3 I. C. C. Decis. 60; I. C. C. Rep.
1896, pp. 37–39; 1897, pp. 94–95.) The Circuit Court upheld the order October,
1893 (57 Fed. Rep. 1002), but the Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the decision
April, 1896 (74 Fed. Rep. 803), and the United States Supreme Court
sustained the Court of Appeals. (167 U. S. 633, May, 1897.) The Commission
made the mistake of resting the case on the 4th or long-haul section
instead of the 2d or 3d sections relating to undue preference, and the railway
should have been allowed the option of removing the discrimination by giving
free cartage in Ionia or making a lower rate there. The order to discontinue
free cartage in Grand Rapids was arbitrary and unnecessary.</p>

1896. The complaint was brought in December, 1889, by the New York
Board of Trade against the Pennsylvania Railroad and others. The New
York Central, B. &amp; O., B. &amp; M., Ill. Central, Union Pacific, Southern
Pacific, Northern Pacific, Texas &amp; Pacific, etc., 33 railroads in all, were joined
as defendants. The Commission held (Jan., 1891) that import traffic is entitled
to no preference. 3 I. C. C. Decis. 417. (See also 4 I. C. C. 447.) The
Circuit Court sustained the Commission in Oct., 1892 (52 Fed. Rep. 187),
and the Court of Appeals in Oct., 1893 (57 Fed. Rep. 948), but the Texas &amp;
Pacific carried the case to the U. S. Supreme Court and the majority of the
Court, reversing the Commission and the Circuit Court, interpreted the Commerce
Act of Congress in such a way as to render substantially inoperative the
main clauses relating to discrimination and the long haul, and practically
nullify another Act of Congress so far as it imposes duties on imports for the
purpose of protecting home industries. The Court accomplished this by
focussing its attention on the phrase relating to dissimilar conditions, instead
of aiming to enforce the act according to its clear purpose and intent. Chief
Justice Fuller and Justices Harlan and Brown dissented, holding that the Interstate
Act requires railways to make the same charge for the same service,
whether the goods carried are domestic or foreign.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r118'>118</a>. Industrial Commission, 1900, vol. iv, pp. 441–442. Shippers in Norfolk,
Nebr. for example, pay the local rate of 45 cents per cwt. (on first-class goods)
to Sioux City on the Missouri River, plus the rate from Sioux City to Chicago,
while Fremont, a rival town near Norfolk, has the same rates as Sioux City,
the local rate not being added in this case to the Missouri River rate. This
gives Fremont manufacturers and shippers a decided advantage over those of
Norfolk, and tends to build up Fremont and stunt the growth of Norfolk.
The witness suggested that “if the rates were established by the Government
instead of at the will and pleasure of the railway managers, it is a natural
conclusion that points having the same general conditions would receive
equal benefits.”</p>

testimony of credible witnesses who say they know of these secret favors far
outweighs the proving power of the negative statements of witnesses who
say they do not know of the said phenomena. Lots of people did not know
till recently that the Equitable paid a famous railroad senator $20,000 a
year for “advice.” And the statements of a multitude that they did not
know of it would weigh nothing against the testimony of 2 or 3 well informed
men who positively stated the facts. Discriminations may go on without the
railroad directors or principal officers knowing about them. They may not
know about them on purpose. Where ignorance is protection ’tis folly to be
wise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Railway men have told me that in many cases leading officers of a railroad
are purposely kept, or keep themselves, in perfect ignorance of all discriminations
and other wrongdoing in order that such officers may appear in
legislative and interstate commerce hearings without knowledge of any facts
that would be prejudicial to the railroad.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r176'>176</a>. More complaints per annum have been filed with the Commission since
the Elkins Act took effect than were filed before the act was passed. The
reports of the I. C. C. show 145 formal complaints filed in 1903 and 1904,
carrying the total to 789, and 888 informal complaints, carrying the total to
3223, making the whole number 1033 in the two years, and 4012 since 1887—more
than 25 percent of the complaints having been filed in the last two
years which constitute only 11 percent of the time covered by the reports of
the Commission. Out of the 62 suits entered in 1904, 50 charge unjust discrimination
of serious character, and nearly all the rest involve discrimination
in some form. The complaints entered for amicable adjustment also relate
in large part to cases of discrimination between persons and places, refusal to
furnish cars, unreasonable delay, unfair classification, discrimination in track
facilities, unfair estimate of weights, allowing competitors to underbill, refusal
of the Transcontinental Passenger Association to grant the American Federation
of Labor the usual special convention rate for their meeting at San
Francisco, refusal to route shipments as ordered by shippers, relatively excessive
rates on vegetables, lumber, lead, drugs, corn products, coal, iron, shoes,
leather, etc., violations of the long and short haul clause, and outright refusal
to accept shipments, besides a number of complaints of overcharges, and
rates alleged to be unreasonable per se.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adding the figures for 1905, which have come to hand since the above was
written, we find that more than double the number of complaints of discrimination
have been made to the Interstate Commerce Commission in the last
three years, since the Elkins Law was passed, than in any equal period before.
The complaints filed in 1903, 1904, and 1905 constitute more than a third of
the whole number of complaints from the beginning of the Commission in
1887. The average number of complaints per year from 1887 to 1902 inclusive
was 186, while the yearly average for 1903–1905 is 534—more than double,
nearly threefold—and five-sixths of the suits entered charge facts that constitute
discrimination of serious character, and nearly all the rest involve
discrimination in some form.</p>

the reports for 1903 and 1904 some favorable comments were made on the
effect of the Elkins Law upon the practice of paying rebates, and says: “Further
experience, however, compels us to modify in some degree the hopeful
expectations then entertained. Not only have various devices for evading the
law been brought into use, but the actual payment of rebates as such has been
here and there resumed. [It never stopped in a good many places, judging by
the La Follette facts and other evidence, including the statements of many
leading railroad men.] Instances of this kind have been established by convincing
proof. More frequently the unjust preference is brought about by
methods which may escape the penalties of the law, but which plainly operate
to defeat its purpose.”</p>

iron company from tariff rates, it (the Santa Fe Railroad) charged the full
tariff rates on interstate shipments of coal by other shippers in not only the
general coal region involved, but in the same coal field. This practice of the
railway company resulted in closing markets for coal to shippers competing
with the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company.” 10 I. C. C. Decis. 473, February,

to get to market on equal terms with the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company,
they got a letter from the Santa Fe traffic office, Nov. 15, 1900, saying that
they could sell their coal to the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company, or keep it.
Mr. Biddle, however, when shown the letter and questioned about it, admitted
the authorship, but said he did not construe the letter as saying anything of
the kind. (I. C. C. Santa Fe Hearing, Dec. 1904, p. 154. The text of the

<p class='c007'><a href='#r191'>191</a>. Mr. Morton’s letter to President Roosevelt, June 5, 1905. Secretary Morton
continues: “The tariff covering this arrangement was published so as to
show the freight rate to be $4.05 per ton instead of the delivered price at El
Paso and Deming, and did not separate the freight rate from the cost of the
coal at the mines, as it should have done. Until the investigation of the case
by the Interstate Commerce Commission I did not know personally how the
matter was being handled, so far as the publication of the tariff was concerned.
My own connection with the case was to see that the traffic was secured to
the Atchison rails, and after that details were left to subordinates.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f192'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r192'>192</a>. Mr. Biddle testified that the same thing had been done for other coal
companies, and in one instance at least it was shown that it had been done for
the Victor Fuel Company, but in this case “the price of the coal and the rate
of freight were kept entirely separate, the price of coal being treated in the
nature of an advance charge.” The Commission says further “If the Colorado
Fuel and Iron Company had in all cases paid the published tariff rate
which was exacted from other shippers, the fact that the price of the coal and the
freight were included in a single item would have worked no practical advantage
to that company so far as we can see. Neither, apparently, would there
have been any reason for this arrangement if the purpose of the parties had been
honest. If, however, there existed upon the part of the Santa Fe Company
an intent to charge the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company less for the transportation
of its coal than the published rate, it is evident that this method of
billing would afford a ready means for concealing the transaction. In point
of fact, during the entire period covered by this investigation (July 1899 to
Nov. 27, 1904) the Santa Fe Company did transport coal for the Colorado
Fuel and Iron Company for less than its open tariff rates, and these concessions
amounted in many cases to the price of the coal itself.” (10 I. C. C.
Decis. 482, Feb. 1905.)</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r195'>195</a>. I confess, however, that I do not see how, in the light of the records in
the Colorado Case, the Santa Fe counsel could tell the Senate Committee
this year that his road had made no discriminating rates (see above, p. 114).
Neither is it easy to see how Mr. Biddle could testify that he had not known
of the payment of any rebates for 12 years. The Commission says the Santa
Fe paid rebates to the Fuel Company till November, 1904, and other preferences have been unearthed, as we shall see hereafter. Some shippers and some
consignees have had better terms than others. Mr. Biddle does not call these
preferences rebates. The Commission sees that when the Santa Fe collected
the published freight rate, $4.05, from the El Paso people and paid for the
coal out of that, instead of collecting the $4.05 as freight and leaving the El
Paso folks to pay for the coal in addition, the effect was the same to the El
Paso people as the payment of a rebate equal to the value of the coal, and
the same to the Fuel Company in respect to securing a monopoly of the market,
and so the Commission, looking at the substance of the matter and the
form too so far as could be judged from the published tariff, called the payments
rebates, or payments out of, or deductions from, the regular tariff
rates.</p>

April and May, 1905, for instance, hundreds and hundreds of cars of strawberries rotted at the stations in North Carolina for want of cars. The Armour
Car-Line could not, or at least did not supply the needed cars, and as they have
an exclusive contract with the Atlantic Coast Line no other cars are in the
field. At one station only 4 cars were furnished in two days and 125 carloads
of berries were left on the platform and the ground to spoil. The loss this
season to the truck growers of this one section from insufficient car service is
estimated at $600,000. (Sen. Com., 1905, pp. 2596, 2619.)</p>

Packers and other shippers owning cars insist on sending their goods in their
own cars, and making the roads pay mileage. If the road refuses, the freight
goes by some other line. “They compel us to take it in their cars and pay
them for the use of them while our own cars stand on the side track, or else
some other road gets the business.” (Testimony of James J. Hill, Sen.

The Beef Trust report of the Bureau of Commerce, 1905, presents some conflicting
evidence and sums up the case with a conservative estimate which
places the average daily run of <em>all</em> the cars owned by Armour and his associates
and used in the beef business at 90 to 100 miles. In the same report,
however, the refrigerator cars of the National Car-Line Company, and of the
Provision Dealers’ Dispatch are reported as running 300 miles a day, and the
cars of Swift and Company are estimated to make 373 miles a day in Iowa.

railway company’s car, we pay 20 cents a day for it for the time we have had
it, and we are in a hurry to get it back; and we load the other man’s car back
if we have anything to put in it. That is always understood. But they do not
want anything put in their cars. They say: ‘Hurry it back; get it around
quickly, and pay us, in place of 20 cents a day, three-fourths of a cent a mile.’
They used to ask a cent a mile, but I think that has been abandoned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Newlands.</span> How much does that amount to a day, say at the
rate of a cent a mile?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Hill.</span> If they got a cent a mile and we hurried that car through to
the coast, we would take it about 300 miles a day, so that they would get
about $3 a day for the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Senator Newlands.</span> So that in the one case you pay 20 cents?</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Hill.</span> And in the other we pay $3.</p>

freight car costs about the same. Private stock cars of good build
cost about $800 each. (See evidence in Hearings on Private Cars, I. C. C.
April, 1904, pp. 19, 100; I. C. C. Rep. 1904, p. 14.) The contracts provide that
the railroads are to carry no perishable goods except in Trust cars if the Trust
cares to furnish the cars. If by chance the railroads use their own or any
other refrigerator cars than those of the Trust they are to charge the full
Trust rates and turn over the said charges to the car-line just as if its cars
had been used.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f273'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r273'>273</a>. The Beef Trust is one of the largest shippers in the world. Its packing-house
shipments from Chicago are said to amount to some three thousand
million pounds (3,000,000,000 lbs.) a year. Its shipments from Kansas City,
Omaha, St. Joe, St. Louis, etc., are also enormous. There is also a vast
traffic in poultry, eggs, dairy products, fruit, and vegetables, that is controlled
by the Trust. Is it any wonder that a railroad president or manager should
refrain from action that might lose him his share of this huge business? It
would make a sad hole in his receipts. Dividends would be emaciated and
might vanish or appear with a minus sign. His stock would sink in Wall
Street. Angry directors, bankers, investors, and stockholders would assail
him and attack his management. And as a result of defying the Trust he
would put himself out of office and his road perhaps in the hands of a
receiver.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f274'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r274'>274</a>. C. B. Hutchins was the inventor of an improved refrigerator car. He
built five cars in 1886, and in 1890 he had the California Fruit Transportation
Company operating $200,000 worth of cars. In two years, 1890 and
1891, the profits amounted to $250,000 or more than the total investment,
and the company thought they had something better than a gold mine. But
the Beef Trust undermined them by railroad favoritism and compelled them
to sell out to the Swifts.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the California Fruit Transportation Company was fighting for its
life with the Armour lines, it presented the Southern Pacific Railway Company
with $100,000 of its stock on condition of receiving an exclusive contract.
The contract was made, but the Armour cars continued to go. An
influence was at work stronger than the exclusive contract and the power of
the California Fruit Transportation Company.</p>

against paying 4 or 5 or 6 times the fair charge for ice, and have now and then
refused to pay, telling the companies they could sue for the charges. But the
car companies knew a better way. They ordered the cars of the disobedient
dealers delayed and notified them that in future icing charges must be prepaid
on all shipments to them or from them. These orders were enforced by the
railroads and the kicking dealers were helpless. (Evidence, etc., 201–203.)</p>

give credit that permits the payment of charges at their end of the line, <em>i. e.</em>,

for the Santa Fe, said to the Senate Committee, 1905, that he wished to put on
record a sweeping denial that the A. T. &amp; S. F. Co. has made any discriminatory
rates or paid any rebates. The next moment, in answer to a question
about the reduction of $25 a car below the published tariff, to which Mr. Leeds
testified as given by the Santa Fe car-line, Mr. Brown said: “It was a rebate
given to every one.” (Rep. Sen. Com. on Interstate Commerce, May, 1905,
p. 3140.) He first said the road did not give any rebates, and then admitted it
did give rebates, but said it gave the same rebate to every one that shipped.
The coal mines that paid the Santa Fe $4 against $2.90 paid by the Colorado
Fuel Co. would hardly agree to that statement. But Mr. Brown had in mind
the car-line case in which they said the same rebate was given to every shipper.
Mr. Leeds said it was a secret rate, and that he went to California and
solicited business from various shippers. Under such circumstances, the fact
that every one who shipped got the rebate does not eliminate discrimination
but accentuates it. The discrimination is against the man who does not ship,
the man who is not informed of the secret rebate. The Santa Fe car-line informed
such dealers as it chose. No others could afford to ship on the Santa Fe.
The instructed dealers could easily hold the market at prices that would prevent
the uninstructed from thinking about shipping such goods.</p>

Formerly a southern buyer going north on such a ticket could stop over in
Philadelphia. But in 1903 this stop-over privilege was revoked, and if the
buyer stopped in Philadelphia and then bought an excursion to New York he
could only stay five days in New York. The result was that southern buyers
began to leave Philadelphia out in the cold and merchants found that “the
present tariff arrangements are working incalculable injury to wholesale

are still true: “There seems to be a general agreement that the issue
of free passes is carried to a degree which makes it a serious evil.... Passes
are still frequently granted to the members of State and national legislatures
and to public officers of many classes.... And stress is often laid on the
opinion that the issue of passes to public officers and legislators involves an
element of bribery.” (Vol. iv, p. 18.)</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f345'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r345'>345</a>. Salaries are paid to favored persons; stock is given to influential people;
and tips on the market are given to congressmen and others whose favor may
be of advantage. And the railroads act against those they dislike as vigorously
as they act in favor of their friends. A curious illustration of the
extent to which railways will sometimes go in their breaches of neutrality
occurred in connection with the recent trip of Thomas W. Lawson in the
West. During the Chatauqua exercises at Ottawa, Kansas, the Santa Fe
advertised specials to run every day. The day that Lawson was to speak,
however, no specials ran, and thousands of people were unable to go, as they
had expected, to hear the man who was attacking Standard Oil and its allies.
The specials ran as advertised every day up to “Lawson Day,” and began
running again the day after. The Santa Fe may not approve of Mr. Lawson’s
statements and in common with all other citizens it has the right to oppose
him with disproof, but isn’t it a little strange in this land of liberty, free
speech, and equal rights, for one of the best railroads in the country to
boycott a Chatauqua day because a man it does not approve of is to speak?</p>

<p class='c007'>Similar experiences with the railroad service are reported from the Chatauqua
at Fairbury, Neb., when Lawson spoke there.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f346'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r346'>346</a>. Mr. Appleton Morgan, writing in the <cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite> for
March, 1887, said (p. 588): “Rebates and discriminations are neither peculiar
to railways nor dangerous to the ‘republic.’ They are as necessary and as
harmless to the former as is the chromo which the seamstress or the shopgirl
gets with her quarter-pound of tea from the small tea-merchant, and no
more dangerous to the latter than are the aforesaid chromos to the small
recipients.”</p>

<p class='c007'>General Manager Van Etten of the B. &amp; A. says discrimination is the
American principle. You find it everywhere. You buy goods at wholesale
much cheaper than you can get them at retail. It is the same with gas and
water and electric light.</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of railroad men take the view that “railroad service” is a commodity
to be sold like any other sort of private property at whatever price
the owner can get or chooses to take.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trouble with these statements (aside from the quantity plea which
may be allowed within reasonable limits) is that the differences between railway
service and ordinary mercantile service are not taken into account.</p>

<p class='c007'>If people found they were unfairly treated by the bakeries or groceries
or shoe stores of a town, it would be easy to establish a new store co-operatively
or otherwise, that would be fair and reasonable, and that possibility
keeps the store fair as a rule even where there is no direct competition. But
when the railways do not deal justly with the people of a town they cannot
build a new road to Chicago or San Francisco. It is the monopoly element,
together with the vital and all-pervading influence of transportation, that
differentiates the railroad service from any ordinary sort of commerce. If
bread stores or shoe stores combined, and, by means of control of raw material
or transportation facilities, erected a practical monopoly or group of
monopolies, and favoritism were shown in the sale of goods by means of
which those who were favored by the monopolists got all the chromos and
low rates, and grew prosperous and fat, while those who were not favored
went chromoless and grew thin in body and emaciated in purse, it is not
improbable that the President would write a message on the bread question
and the leather question, and a Senate committee would be considering legislation
to alleviate the worst evils of the bread and shoe monopolies without
stopping the game entirely.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f347'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r347'>347</a>. In their established tariffs our railroads do apply the same rates per
hundred whether the goods moved in carloads or train loads. The Commission
has held that the law requires this, and Commissioner Prouty says that
the open adoption of any different rule would create an insurrection that
Congress would hear from from all parts of the country; but he thinks
that in certain cases, live-stock and perishable fruit for example, the railroads
should have a right to make lower rates by the train-load than by the carload.
In reference to cost of service there is ground for such a difference, but on
grounds of public policy is it not a mistake to favor the giant shipper in this
way and so help the building of trusts and monopolies?</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r350'>350</a>. We have seen earlier in this chapter that a number of railroad men and
others told the Senate Committee that they believed rebates and discriminations
to have ceased. In his excellent book, “The Strategy of Great Railroads,”
Mr. Spearman says: “Alexander J. Cassatt has made unjust discrimination in
railroad traffic a thing of the past.” Sometimes we are assured: “There can
be no doubt but that, on the whole, the freight rates of the country have been
adjusted in very nearly the best way possible for the upbuilding of the country’s
commerce.” (See “Freight Rates that were made by the Railroads,”
W. D. Taylor, <cite>Review of Reviews</cite>, July, 1905, p. 73.) For one who has in
mind the facts brought out in this book, comment on these statements is hardly
necessary. There is no doubt that President Cassatt is a railroad commander
of exceptional power, but he has not vanquished the smokeless rebate, nor
driven the hosts of unjust discrimination from the railroads of the United
States.</p>

is plain that, if a railway company is permitted to become interested in any
kind of business competitive with business in the carrying on of which for
others it is engaged, the business in which it is interested can be made to
prosper at the expense of the business in which it has no interest. The
temptation to unfair discrimination in such a case is so powerful that it
ought to be removed.” (Report, 1896, p. 29.)</p>

has never earnestly enforced existing laws. President Ramsey of the

and no further legislation is needed to stop discrimination (Same, p. 1959).</p>

inadequacies of redress under existing laws discourage shippers from efforts
to obtain relief. Mr. C. W. Robinson, representing the New Orleans Board

luck with their lumber cases before the United States courts that they are
discouraged.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r380'>380</a>. Many of the States have strong laws, but the inharmonious, uncoordinated
efforts of individual States have proved of little avail against the
giant railway systems. Of the 31 States which have established railway
commissions, 22 have given the commissions more or less of the rate-making
power. For example, the Alabama Code, 1886, gives the Commission authority
“to revise the tariffs and increase or reduce any of the rates.” The California
Constitution, 1880, confers power “to establish rates;”  Florida Laws,
1887, “to make and fix reasonable and just rates;” Georgia Code, 1882, “to
make reasonable and just rates;” Illinois Laws, 1878, “to make for each
railway a schedule of reasonable maximum rates;” Iowa, 1888, and South
Carolina, 1888, the same as Illinois; Minnesota, 1887, power “to compel
railways to adopt such rates and classification as the Commission declares to
he equal and reasonable;” South Dakota, 1890, the same; Mississippi, 1884,
“to revise tariffs;” New Hampshire, 1883, “to fix tables of maximum charges.”
(See 63 N. H. 259.) Kansas: on complaint and proof of unreasonable charge
Commission may fix reasonable rates, and if companies don’t comply they may
be sued for damages. The Massachusetts Commission has “authority to revise
the tariffs and fix the rates for the transportation of milk” (158 Mass. 1).
In New York the board may notify the railways of changes in the rates, etc.,
it deems requisite, and the Supreme Court may in its discretion issue mandamus,
etc., subject to appeal. In Nebraska the State Supreme Court has held
that general language prohibiting unreasonable rates, and giving the Commission
power to enforce the law, is sufficient to confer authority to fix
reasonable rates in place of those found unreasonable, such authority being
essential to the efficient execution of the law against excessive rates (22 Neb.
313).</p>

<p class='c007'>In none of the States does the power to regulate rates appear to have produced
results of much value. In some States, Georgia, Texas, Nebraska, Iowa,
etc., the power has been at times vigorously used, but the effect has been to
antagonize the railroads, which have so much power that is beyond the reach
of any State Commission that they can arrange their tariffs and service so as
to work against the aggressive States and disgust the people with the consequences
of trying to control the rates. Senator Newlands, who is sincerely on
the people’s side in the struggle for justice in transportation, voiced the common
opinion when he said in the United States Senate, January 11, 1905,
“As to the rate-regulating power, my judgment is, and it is the belief of
almost all experienced men in this country, that the rate-regulating power
exercised by the States has not, as a rule, been beneficially exercised.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f381'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r381'>381</a>. The Bill provides that “Whenever&#160;... the Interstate Commerce Commission
shall&#160;... make any finding or ruling declaring any rate, regulation
or practice whatsoever affecting the transportation of persons or property to be
unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory the Commission shall have power and
it shall be its duty to declare and order what shall be a just and reasonable rate,
practice or regulation to be&#160;... imposed or followed in the future in place of
that found to be unreasonable” etc. It also provides that the order of the Commission
shall take effect 30 days after notice, but may on appeal within 60 days
be reviewed by a special transportation court having exclusive jurisdiction of
all such cases. By Section 12, the case is to be reviewed on the original record,
except when there is newly discovered evidence which was not known at the
hearing before the Commission, or could not have been known with due diligence, and the findings of fact by the Commission are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> evidence of

by the Commission upon Congress in previous reports. On page 11 of the
Report for December, 1905, the Commission says: “We have also called
attention to the fact that certain carriers now refuse to make the statistical
returns required by the Commission. For example, railways are required,
among other things, to indicate what permanent improvements have been
charged to operating expenses. Without an answer to this question it is
impossible to determine to what extent gross earnings have been used in
improving the property and the actual cost of operation proper.... Certain
important railways decline to furnish this information at all, and others furnish
it in a very imperfect and unsatisfactory manner.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f386'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r386'>386</a>. As the galley proofs of this book go back to the printer, the Hepburn
Bill has passed the House by a big majority. If passed by the Senate and
put in force, it promises to operate as a serious check upon the abuses connected
with private cars, terminal railroads and midnight tariffs, but it does
not touch at all nine-tenths of the methods of discrimination. We have seen
that between 60 and 70 different methods of unjust discrimination between
persons and places are in use in our railway business to-day. The fixing of
a maximum rate cannot prevent either secret rate cutting or favoritism in
facilities and services, or even open discrimination in the arrangement of
classifications and adjustment of rates between different localities.</p>

<p class='c007'>No doubt this law in the hands of an able and honest commission would
do much good, but it cannot reach the heart of the railroad problem, which is
the unjust discrimination between persons and places. No amount of maximum
rate-fixing or prescribing of regulations can destroy discrimination so
long as we have the pressure of great private interests driving the railroads
into the practice of favoritism.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of railroad legislation in this country shows that the railways
do not respect or obey the law when it conflicts with the fundamental financial
interests and orders of the railway owners and trust magnates, whose gigantic
power represents the real sovereignty and control in America to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>On page 3 of the House Report, 59th Congress, 1st Session, No. 591,
January 27, 1906, accompanying the Hepburn Bill the Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce says: “It is proper to say to those who complain
of this legislation that the necessity for it is the result of the misconduct of
carriers.... If the carriers had in good faith accepted existing statutes and
obeyed them there would have been no necessity for increasing the powers
of the Commission or the enactment of new coercive measures.”</p>

<p class='c007'>What reason is there to believe that the railroads will accept a new
statute in good faith and obey it any more than any former law? On the
contrary, the probability is that if the Hepburn Bill becomes a law the main
effect will be to compel railway managers and counsel to sit up nights for a
time planning methods to evade and overcome the new provisions. Even if
Congress gave the full power at first demanded by the President, to fix the
precise rate to be charged, the general effect would probably be that railways
would exert themselves to control the Commission. They have always at
hand the weapon of practically interminable litigation, and it is very doubtful
whether the railroad representatives in the United States Senate will permit
any law to pass until it is amended so that the review in the courts shall go
to the merits of the Commission’s order in each case. Powerful interests are
opposed to any provision that will permit the fixing of a rate, even a maximum,
to go into effect before it is connected already with the Federal courts.</p>

It is absurd to forbid co-operation for the maintenance of reasonable rates
and prevention of superfluous transportation, or any other honest purpose.
Traffic agreements may secure a co-ordination of service approaching that
which would be attained by unity of management. The fetish-worship of
competition is one of the prime curses of our economic ignorance. We might
as well worship destruction, injustice, and inefficiency. Moreover, competition
of the kind that protects the public from oppressive rates cannot be maintained
in the railway world. Let the railways unite, and then control them,
insisting on the dominance of the public interest so far as necessary to accomplish
justice.</p>

railroads cannot lawfully agree on rates to competitive points. But no law
or decision can well prevent railroad managers from meeting and coming to
an understanding that they will adopt the same rates to such points. No
contract in restraint of trade or to limit competition is necessary,—if each
railroad publishes the same rates between “competitive” points and maintains
them, competition as to rates is killed as effectually as if there were a pool
or a traffic association with a written agreement.</p>

railroads that unless rates were restored, the lowest cut rates that had
been made by any line would be adopted by all, to punish the rebaters and
stop them from getting business thereby. At a meeting July 26, 1882, 30
railroads being represented, a resolution was unanimously adopted, directing
agents at connecting points to examine waybills, and when rates were found
to have been cut, to hold the freight at the expense of the initial line until
the waybills had been corrected.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f399'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r399'>399</a>. President Tuttle agrees with the Commission on this point. In his testimony
to the Senate Committee, 1905, he said that the company’s books
would not show rebates, etc., “unless they wanted them to. I will say to you
frankly that if a company intended to evade the law by giving rebates and
commissions they would find some way of so covering them up that all the
experts on the face of the earth could not find them. If you assume at the
beginning that the railroad management is deliberately going into violations
of the law it is not going to make records of those things which can ever be
found out.” (Sen. Com. 1905, p. 952.) But President Tuttle said: “There is
ample opportunity to ascertain if rebates exist. There are always opportunities.
The competitive shipper knows about it. There is always enough of
the loose end hanging out somewhere so that if the Interstate Commerce
Commission or whoever is authorized to move in those matters will take the
time to proceed upon the lines of information that they can always get they
will be easily ferreted out and punished. I do not think there is any evidence
that the Interstate Commerce Commission has tried to enforce the Elkins Law.” (Same, p. 951.) Shippers have, however, often stated that they
felt sure some concession was being made to their rivals, but they could not
tell what, and in many cases there is simply a vague suspicion; no one knows
whether others are paying the tariff rates or not. And railroad men have
admitted, as in the B. &amp; A. case, that no shipper knew what rates others were
getting.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r401'>401</a>. Out of 37 passenger cases (20 rate cases and 17 miscellaneous) the decision
was favorable to the complainant in 9; and in 316 freight cases the
decision was for the complainant in 185 cases. In 70 of the freight cases the
complaint was of excessive charges (half of them charging discrimination
also, or relative excess as well as absolute excess); 119 related to charges
relatively unreasonable; 52 concerned long and short haul abuses; 20 unreasonable
classification, 8 unfair distribution of cars, 41 miscellaneous. Ninety-six
of the 316 freight cases were dismissed, 13 settled while pending, 4 left
without a general statement and no order, and 17 held for further action.
Nearly 90 percent of all the cases, passenger and freight, related directly to
some form of discrimination, and indirectly discrimination of some sort was
an element in practically every case.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f402'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r402'>402</a>. The 8 cases are the New York and Northern Case (3 I. C. C. 542) the

Colorado Fuel and Iron Case (6 I. C. C. 488) the St. Cloud Case (89 I. C. C.
346) the Savannah Case (8 I. C. C. 377) the Tifton Case (9 I. C. C. 160) and
the California Orange Routing Case (9 I. C. C. 182). Mr. Willcox thinks
the Minneapolis Case and the Colorado Case should be crossed off because the
carriers complied with the orders while suit was pending, so that there was
no decision on the merits. He says the decision was not on the merits in the
New York Case, the St. Cloud Case, or the Tifton Case. In the Social Circle
Case the Supreme Court sustained the order in respect to discrimination, but
reversed it so far as it attempted to fix a maximum rate. In the Orange
Case the Circuit Court sustained the Commission, but an appeal was taken at
once to the Supreme Court. In the Savannah Naval Stores Case the Circuit
Court sustained the Commission and no appeal was taken. Two cases in
favor of the Commission in the Court of Appeals and one-half a case in the
Supreme Court, and one of the circuit decisions is on appeal—one and one-half
final affirmatives on the merits out of 34. One would think that Mr.
Willcox might allow the Commission the three cases that were decided in their
favor although the court did not find it necessary to go into the merits of the
matter, and he seems to be less generous about the Colorado Case than Mr.
Newcomb, who says the Commission was sustained by the court.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f406'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r406'>406</a>. The railroads would prefer a court to a Commission if any public body
is to have power over rates. They know that proceedings in court are likely
to be troubled with long delays, and great expense, and that courts are very
delicate about determining what is a reasonable rate. In the Reagan case
(154 U. S. 362) the Supreme Court says: “It has always been recognized
that if the carrier attempted to charge a shipper an unreasonable sum the
courts had jurisdiction to inquire into that matter and award to the shipper
any amount exacted from him in excess of a reasonable rate; and, also, in a
reverse case, to render judgment in favor of the carrier for the amount found
to be a reasonable rate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In any case of suit by a shipper to recover damages for unreasonable
charges the court would have to determine what was a reasonable rate in
order to fix the measure of damages, but Chairman Knapp of the I. C. C.
says he does not know of a case in which suit was ever brought (Sen. Com.
1905, p. 3301). The fact that very many complaints have been made of
unreasonable rates and no suits brought in the courts indicates that court
procedure is regarded as inadequate. Courts are by nature judicial, not legislative
or executive. And the remedy which can be administered by them
in these railroad cases is uncertain, limited, and indirect. (Sen. Com.
p. 3362.)</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f419'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r419'>419</a>. A few illustrations of the vigorous manner in which this law works out
in practice may be of advantage here:</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hungarian Government at a single stroke, in 1889, reduced State railway
fares 40 to 80 percent. Austria and Prussia have also made great reductions
in railway charges. Belgium started in the thirties with the very low
rate of ⅘ of a cent on her public railways. In New Zealand and Australia
also the Government managements have adopted the settled policy of reducing
railroad rates as fast as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>When England made the telegraph public in 1870, rates were lowered 30
to 50 percent at once, and still further reductions were afterwards made.</p>

<p class='c007'>When France took over the telephone in 1889, rates were reduced from $116
to $78 per year in Paris, and from $78 to $39 elsewhere, except in Lyons,
where the charge was made $58.50.</p>

<p class='c007'>Private turnpikes, bridges and canals levy sufficient tolls to get what profit
may be possible; but when the same highways, bridges and canals become
public the tolls are often abolished entirely, rendering such facilities of transportation
free, and when charges are made they are lower than the rates of
private monopolies under similar conditions, and generally reach the vanishing
point as soon as the capital is paid off or before.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Glasgow took the management of her street railways in 1894, fares
were reduced at once about 33 percent, the average fare dropped to about 2
cents, and 35 percent of the fares were 1 cent each. Since then further reductions
have been made, and the average fare now is little more than a cent
and a half; over 50 percent reduction in 6 years, while we pay the 5 cent fare
to the private companies in Boston and other cities of the United States the
same as we did 6 years ago, instead of the 2½ cent fare we would pay if the
same percentage of reduction had occurred here as in Glasgow.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Baker’s Manual of American Waterworks, the charges of
private water companies in the United States average 43 percent excess above
the charges of public waterworks for similar service. In some states investigation
shows that private water rates are double the public rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>For commercial electric lighting Prof. John R. Commons says that private
companies charge 50 to 100 percent more than public plants.</p>

<p class='c007'>We could offer many other illustrations of the law that public ownership
tends to lower rates than private monopoly, but this discussion may be sufficient
to indicate the complexion of the facts.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r420'>420</a>. The sixteenth annual report of the Commission, dated 1905, and covering
the year 1904, has come just in time for a note before the galleys are
made up into pages. Of the 103 suits entered before the Commission in 1904,
about a quarter (25) relate to undue preference, rebates, refusal or neglect to
afford such reasonable facilities as were accorded to others under similar
circumstances; and most of the other cases, charging unreasonable rates, etc.,
were really based on some element of unjust discrimination in one form or
another. (See Appendix <a href='#AppendixB'>B</a>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r421'>421</a>. While this book is on the press, the eighth report, covering 1902 and
1903, has come to hand. More than half the 180 new complaints filed in the
2 years directly relate to questions of discrimination—undue preference,
rebates, denial of facilities accorded to others, excessive charges as compared
with other rates, etc., and nearly all the 180 cases involve discrimination
directly or indirectly. (See Appendix <a href='#AppendixB'>B</a>.)</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
